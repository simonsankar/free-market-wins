You heard of _"muh roads"_, here's _"muh mail"_ 

A relative's income tax refund took 22 days to travel from Port of Spain to Piarco - a distance that could be driven in under 45 minutes. This is not simply incompetence but appears strategically beneficial for the government.

While they demand immediate payment from you through automatic deductions, when it's their turn to return your money:

- They rely on an inefficient mail system
- Your funds sit in government accounts for those extra weeks, earning interest
- The delay creates a cash flow advantage for the government
- Your financial hardship during illness is extended unnecessarily

The government insists mail delivery is "essential" yet tolerates extreme inefficiency when it serves their financial interests. They collect promptly but repay sluggishly, creating a one-sided arrangement where your immediate needs during illness are subordinated to bureaucratic convenience.

This asymmetry - swift collection versus delayed repayment - further demonstrates how the system is designed to benefit the collector rather than serve the contributors who fund it.
