CEPEP is tasked with general maintenance of the streets/parks etc
They do a horrendous job of this with infrequent cutting of grass in the fields

e.g. They cut 1/3 of the field, then another 2 weeks another 1/3 and so on, which means you have a sectioned field with different grass lengths. On top of that, they try to get around cutting the grass as much a possible and often cut the grass super low, exposing the grass tufts which leads to patchy regrowth when mixed with dry season weather and wet season muddying and erosion of the soil.
This leads to a barely used field though the number of kids in the area is relatively the same if not more than circa 2000-2012

In previous years, Robbie, a neighbour, held a kids football camp on Saturday mornings and would mow the lawn himself on the Friday if it was uncut. Sometimes he'd pay maybe 100-200 to one of the teens living nearby to cut the grass.

Morons usually say if it weren't for taxes, we wouldn't be able to crowdfund enough to make things cheaper and more available. Here is a case where in spite of wasted tax money, the free market is able to get it done more efficiently, i.e. Robbie invests money for a lawn mower + fuel + labour and still makes a profit with his camp.

Therefore one could imagine if this CEPEP money was returned to it's owners, Robbie could collect donations from the neighbourhood (voluntarily of course), for up-keeping the field and improving its condition. But alas, this is why we can't have nice things, we employ CEPEP to cut the grass which they don't use or have the incentive to ensure that it's done well which goes for all govt run services as it turns out.
