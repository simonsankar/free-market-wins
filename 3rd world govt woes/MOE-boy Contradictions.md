[[Law of Non-Contradiction]] states that contradictions are `false` therefore all of these are wrong â€” ðŸ¤¡

- Advocates for the govt stealing peoples money to pay for goods/services/protection
	- Believes it is necessary to fund healthcare _(but muh cancer patients ðŸ¤’)_, but refuses to diverge funds from crappy ministries _(arts and culture)_ back to the citizens or towards the healthcare ministry _(so much for fighting cancer ðŸ˜ž)_ ðŸ¤¡
	- This implies that their are some fields/sectors/interests that need not be essential for wider society, but for a select minority who engage in it
	  Then why are private actors punished _(taxes/regulations)_, for doing the same _(engaging in their own specialised interest)_, and their money used to fund the govt's special interests? Are we saying the govt's interests overrides the individual's interests? Isn't the govt supposed to be _for the people_? ðŸ¤¡
- Cares about how _rich/other_ people save/invest/'hoard'/splurge their money â€” _(*shakes fists* grrrr damn you ELON/BEZOS!! ðŸ˜ )_, but does not care about how the govt uses _other_ people's money
	- When people buy luxurious items with the money they earned it is seen as a _waste_, and that it could be put to better use for the benefit of 'more people'
	  However, govt spending __is__ more wasteful and demonstrably so _(*cough cough* spending 50-35k USD on azure for 3 PHP sites with like 5 users ðŸ¤¯)_, yet is seen as a necessary waste _(no matter the cost)_ for providing _xyz_ goods/services to the 'public'
	  Unlike the rich person 'wasting' his **own** money and having to deal with the consequences himself, the govt wastes everyone's money and suffer little to no consequences since they are assured taxes by gunpoint, the taxpayer however is the biggest loser since it is their labor that goes in vain.  ðŸ¤¡
	- Cares about 'smiles' over the cost of providing xyz _(we must maximize the utils!)_. Wtf is this 'smile' metric?, this is a made up subjective unit that has no objective way of measuring it â€” therefore rubbish. Given this rubbish metric, then the same could be said about the rich guy spending his money on luxurious items _(over 9000 smiles in a Mercedes-Benz AMG - 3000 in a Rolex ðŸ˜‚)_
	  If we want to maximize 'smiles', then why would we ignore costs? Efficiency by definition is ratio of useful work vs output, which means if we provide xyz regardless of cost, that we are __not__ efficient therefore we are not maximizing 'smiles/utils/etc' ðŸ¤¡
- Dislikes monopolies, especially for "essential" goods/services but advocates for centralisation of these "essential" goods/services
	- Supports public goods/services since its "cheaper" for all, _(side note: no, the rich subsidies it with their higher tax contribution)_, but these same govt organisations prevent individuals from paying less with regulations/laws that protect their monopoly as sole provider of these essential services ðŸ¤¡
	   eg. 
		   - T&TEC makes it [illegal](https://www.energy.gov.tt/our-business/alternative-energy/renewable-energy-electricity-generation-in-trinidad-and-tobago/) to install solar panels in an equatorial country unless the [household makes <10kTTD/month](https://ttec.co.tt/default/utilities-assistance-program) ðŸ¤ª
		   - WASA makes it illegal to use rivers/streams or collect rainfall _(ah yes they own the sky ðŸ«¡)_
	- In favour of import customs/duties on products we don't/can't produce which obviously restricts access to goods + bolsters existing businesses strangle hold on these goods ðŸ¤¡
	- Against big businesses 'price gouging' yet is okay with preferential laws/regulations that favour businesses that import goods vs the average person importing goods
	  i.e., it is only those with wealth via business that can import goods at decent rates that are then sold on for big profit margins and the individual who has no need to import goods in bulk, has to choose between a 'price gouged' import or a highly taxed import which leads to a monopolising of goods through existing or new businesses ðŸ¤¡
	-  Dislikes bitcoin, a decentralized monetary system capped at 21M, but in favour of central banks who monopolize the counterfeiting of currency â€” essentially stealing purchasing power from savers (increased money supply = less value per unit) ðŸ¤¡ 
- Believes Capitalism leads to slavery due to wage labour but advocates for socialism
	- Slavery is not impossible through any system, evil exists get over it. 
	  Wage labour is not slavery in the slightest, it is a completely **consensual** agreement by worker - employer. You get paid what the market deems fit and it's your choice to accept it or move on. Feeling 'underpaid' does not equal slavery, that is an intellectually bankrupt conclusion . No one owes you your desired salary they aren't your daddy _(but muh minimum wage ðŸ˜«)_. You have the choice to either level up, or leave and go elsewhere â€” neither of which are afforded to a real slave. 
	  Socialism however has slavery aspects built in as it is the institutionalised redistribution of private property through **coercion** â€” you cannot opt out. The productive class (private sector) is forced to pay a percentage to the unproductive class (public sector) â€” straight up percentage-based slavery baked into slavery. ðŸ¤¡
	- The _'shmuck'_ Robert Breedlove has coined the phrase _"A slave is someone with an effective tax rate of 100%"_. This is self explanatory since the slave's entire labour goes towards his master. If we contrast it with today's democracies where we believe in the west that slavery is _over_, we find that not to be the case, we are all a percentage of a slave be it 10/20/25/30% of a slave as we are held by gunpoint and thrown in a cage if we refuse to fund the state. Show me a free-market business that behaves like that? ðŸ¤¡

# Here's the tldr as to why your concoction of socialism is false and Anarcho-capitalism is true (Aggression vs Non-aggression)
1.  Semantics so everyone's on the same page, _(I know its hard for you, but grant me a smidge of intellectual honesty will ya ðŸ¥º)_
   Aggression: The **initiation** of conflict â€” self-defense is **not** aggression, that is a justified response towards aggression
   Conflict: Contradictory actions
```
eg. Desert island, Robert finds a stick and fashions it into a spear to go spear-fishing, Murray wants to use it to stoke his fire â€” conflict arises, both Robert and Murray cannot spear-fish + stoke fire at the same time with the stick.
```   
2. Two ways we can solve conflicts over scarce resources
   a) Using aggression â€” (steal/murder/harm/coercion etc)
   b) Using non-aggresion â€” property rights
3. Aggression-based ethics _(ðŸ¤®)_
   These are ethics which permit aggression in some configuration, eg:
   - Racism - by race
   - Marxism (full on socialism) - by owner vs worker dynamic
   - Monarchy - by royalty
   - Democracy (mild socialism) - by vote
   - Imperialism - by military force
   Forget the technical details and merits of each, they all allow for aggression in some form, so firstly can aggression be justified?
4. Argument from Argument â€” showing aggression to be false ðŸ¤“
   - argumentation is and must be a _conflict-free_ interaction used to derive truth values - arguing otherwise results in an obvious contradiction
   - arguing for aggression in particular, presupposes the norm of _non-aggression_ as argumentation is a _conflict-free_ interaction meaning this pro-aggression argument is a performative contradiction. 
     This is akin to saying, _"I ought not speak"_ or _"People are always indifferent to doing things"_ or _"We ought not argue"_ â€” the very act of proposing these propositions, presupposes the very **opposite** of the claim being made therefore contradicting oneself and thus being false. i.e. _"I ought not speak (by speech)"_ = `FALSE` = _"I ought aggress (by non-aggression)"_  ðŸ˜Ž
     Trying to evade this conclusion by saying you don't need to argue for your "pro-agression ethic"  is the same thing religion does which would mean you become the very thing you are against.
5. Aggression is false so Non-aggression is true ðŸ’¡
   From argumentation we know aggression is false and additionally we know property rights exists, as to deny this in argumentation would be to presuppose one's _self-ownership_ as well as the interlocutor's â€” _(why else would you need to engage with him if you truly owned him? clearly you do not and cannot)_ 
   Basically, through argumentation we know that people own themselves _(SHOCKER! ðŸ˜±)_, therefore you cannot justify aggression towards another individual no matter your arbitrary reason.
   This is the justification of the NAP (Non-aggression Principle), which underpins consensual trade â€” the free market â€” Capitalism at large. 
   
   So if you hold logic to be true, any ethic that allows even the tiniest form of aggression is FALSE
   QED Bitch. ðŸ–•
