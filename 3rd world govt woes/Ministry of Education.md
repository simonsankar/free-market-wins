where do we even begin?
- 35k/month on cloud infrastructure with ~0 users
- ~0 users since their solutions were to poorly understood problems (no incentives to understand)
- bureaucratic segmented dysfunctional mess (OJTs having a say/bosses not being bosses)
- overinflated cost of production (crazy money for trivial solutions)
- horrendous corporate structure (contract workers/public servants)
- overall low time preference garbage
