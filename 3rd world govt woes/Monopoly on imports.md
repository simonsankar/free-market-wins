Like with the case of ANY govt organisation, customs/imports are widely held as being incompetent, unjust, predatory, illogical and arbitrary in its services

- If you order something and filed it under the correct category but they charge you for a different category (usually when the correct category has less or no duties/customs), you have to go to POS and file some complaint and hope for the best it gets resolved. This is insanely inconvenient and the outcome is not certain to be in your favour an many people do not even bother to engage further with such a lousy entity. This is also compounded by the fact that most people use couriers in order not to deal with the customs office in the first place.
- Businesses don't pay the same taxes on their imports vs a regular citizen, leading to more centralisation and monopolising of goods and services.
