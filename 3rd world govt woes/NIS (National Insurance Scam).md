National Insurance systems are often fundamentally misaligned with the needs of workers. Let me restate the key absurdities:

The National Insurance scheme operates as a forced financial transaction where:

1. You're required to surrender a portion of your earnings monthly with no choice
2. When actually sick and unable to work, you must petition to receive back only a fraction of what was taken from you
3. The system arbitrarily decides how much of your own money you deserve to receive back
4. Long-term illness that exceeds your contribution period creates uncertain coverage
5. Despite potentially years of contributions, you can only claim for specific illness periods, not proportional to your total input

This arrangement essentially forces you to loan your money to the government, only to potentially receive a partial repayment when you're most vulnerable and in need. The system treats workers as expendable resources rather than humans who require meaningful support during health crises.
