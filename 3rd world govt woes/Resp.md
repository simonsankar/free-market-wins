Ok, this is going to keep dragging, and I don’t want to keep blowing up the other guys' phones lol, so this is my last response.

It is clear we are on completely opposite sides of the spectrum, which is weird because I consider myself to be quite reasonable and open to other opinions. Throughout this entire discussion, you have yet to disprove the main point I was trying to make about Elon being a liar and a walking conflict of interest (that’s how this latest convo started). Instead, you’ve pivoted the conversation or simply said he’s a billionaire, so you trust him - crazy stuff. The facts are simply not on your side, and maybe someday you will understand that.

Our current form of government did not just pop into existence. Humans have historically tried every kind and variation we can think of (including the type you are suggesting), and this is where we are. Is it perfect? Hell no. Will it ever be? Probably not. Why? Because humans are imperfect beings, and greed and the lack of empathy for our fellow man will always come back to bite us - you are a case in point unfortunately.

To your points:

1. I placed “free” in quotes for a reason… I came from a poor family. I CANNOT imagine where I would be if I lived in a country where only “the haves” got by. So, on the contrary, I do not feel “entitled” to the wealth of others; I am actually humble and grateful that now I am in a position to pay taxes that I KNOW are helping someone else in need. Not saying this to brag, but I do pretty damn well for myself. The taxes I pay now are MORE than my salary when I started working, so TRUST me when I say I feel it, and I REALLY wish government was more efficient. I think your perspective is selfish and short-sighted, and you are only saying it because you are young, you do ok for yourself, and you can afford what you need. God forbid something happened to you and you could no longer provide for yourself, then what? I hope you are not expecting some government to assist you when your savings run out…

2. ⁠I’m not sure what kind of society we would have if taxes were optional. God help the least fortunate among us if it was.

3. ⁠My payback point was simply about the fact that the government assisted you and your family and millions of others, but now you don’t want to participate. So, if you have so much contempt for the system, you are free to leave, but only after you’ve paid back what was spent on you. Since you’re a capitalist, I would hate to think you would leave that debt unpaid, even though there was no formal contract other than your country's LAWS that ENSURED you had access to education and healthcare…


4. ⁠I don’t even get your slavery point. If helping your fellow citizen through taxes is slavery to you, you may need to brush up on your history. No one is forcing you to go and physically build a house or feed someone or cut grass by the road; all they require is a portion of your income, and then you can go live your life.


5. ⁠You’re going to Argentina? Of course, I wish you all the best. But surely you’re not going to use your Trinidadian passport to go there, right? Because that would be akin to slavery, right? The airlines require it for you travel, and I would hate to think you would knowingly participate in slavery. Also, won’t you be paying the government taxes associated with air travel? And when you get there, I hope you declare yourself a sovereign citizen. Surely won’t apply for a government ID or driver’s license or use the subsidised public transport system… I really hope you get my point. 

Anyways, all the best.
