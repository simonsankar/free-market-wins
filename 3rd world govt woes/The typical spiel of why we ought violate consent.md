Ok, this is going to keep dragging, and I don’t want to keep blowing up the other guys' phones lol, so this is my last response.

It is clear we are on completely opposite sides of the spectrum, which is weird because I consider myself to be quite reasonable and open to other opinions. Throughout this entire discussion, you have yet to disprove the main point I was trying to make about Elon being a liar and a walking conflict of interest (that’s how this latest convo started). Instead, you’ve pivoted the conversation or simply said he’s a billionaire, so you trust him - crazy stuff. The facts are simply not on your side, and maybe someday you will understand that.

Our current form of government did not just pop into existence. Humans have historically tried every kind and variation we can think of (including the type you are suggesting), and this is where we are. Is it perfect? Hell no. Will it ever be? Probably not. Why? Because humans are imperfect beings, and greed and the lack of empathy for our fellow man will always come back to bite us - you are a case in point unfortunately.

To your points:

1. I placed “free” in quotes for a reason… I came from a poor family. I CANNOT imagine where I would be if I lived in a country where only “the haves” got by. So, on the contrary, I do not feel “entitled” to the wealth of others; I am actually humble and grateful that now I am in a position to pay taxes that I KNOW are helping someone else in need. Not saying this to brag, but I do pretty damn well for myself. The taxes I pay now are MORE than my salary when I started working, so TRUST me when I say I feel it, and I REALLY wish government was more efficient. I think your perspective is selfish and short-sighted, and you are only saying it because you are young, you do ok for yourself, and you can afford what you need. God forbid something happened to you and you could no longer provide for yourself, then what? I hope you are not expecting some government to assist you when your savings run out…

2. ⁠I’m not sure what kind of society we would have if taxes were optional. God help the least fortunate among us if it was.

3. ⁠My payback point was simply about the fact that the government assisted you and your family and millions of others, but now you don’t want to participate. So, if you have so much contempt for the system, you are free to leave, but only after you’ve paid back what was spent on you. Since you’re a capitalist, I would hate to think you would leave that debt unpaid, even though there was no formal contract other than your country's LAWS that ENSURED you had access to education and healthcare…


4. ⁠I don’t even get your slavery point. If helping your fellow citizen through taxes is slavery to you, you may need to brush up on your history. No one is forcing you to go and physically build a house or feed someone or cut grass by the road; all they require is a portion of your income, and then you can go live your life.


5. ⁠You’re going to Argentina? Of course, I wish you all the best. But surely you’re not going to use your Trinidadian passport to go there, right? Because that would be akin to slavery, right? The airlines require it for you travel, and I would hate to think you would knowingly participate in slavery. Also, won’t you be paying the government taxes associated with air travel? And when you get there, I hope you declare yourself a sovereign citizen. Surely won’t apply for a government ID or driver’s license or use the subsidised public transport system… I really hope you get my point. 

Anyways, all the best.

Elon point: you are working of a false assumption that these programs ought to be there and I do not, which i why i elaborated my position and got down the the crux of the argument i.e. should we **force** people to pay for stuff for other people

1. coming from a poor background isnt an argument as to why people should be forced to pay for you — you agreed with the farmer/poor passerby example so idk why you think this emotional argument is valid here
2. Youd have idk.. the history of mordern civilization, immigrants moved with no wealth and built wealth, there were no govt handouts at the beginning of the US/Argentina and many other countries, people came, worked the land and became wealthier (the us fought a war over 2% tax lol) the welfare state is only a new cancerous idea, people existed fine before it else we wont be here
3. I debunked your payback point and you ignored all of it it seems, how can I have debt if you cannot point to an agreement where they spent $X on me, that either myself or my parents consented to? Can youtube/chatgpt/vscode suddenly bill you for using their services — no cuz there's no contractual agreement and rightfully so. Im sure youd throw a fit if they decided to so keep the same energy here
4. I made it plain and simple for you to understand the slavery point, a colonial slave had an effective tax rate of 100% (all revenue he generated went to his master). Since taxes are also by gun-point, whatever the rate (10,15,25%), that you are forced to pay makes you that percentage of a slave. It matters not how it is spent thereafter. If you were hungry and a robber stole your wallet and bought you a hotdog does it magically not qualify as theft? Ofc not.
5. Nice try equating my forced use of monopolistic systems with "benefiting" from taxes—I comply under threat of jail. A state ID isn’t inherently necessary for travel; governments impose this. EU/MERCOSUR travel, for example, doesn’t require a passport. I’ve spent 8 months in LATAM, 6 in Argentina, never used public transport because it's terrible. Assuming I would secretly rely on government services is lazy—I only use them when forced (e.g., driver’s permit, residency). When there's a state monopoly with no alternative (the state preventing competition), I have no choice but to use it if the need arises. Otherwise, I always prefer the superior free-market option
   
  I expected more logic from a compsci-oriented person, not emotional arguments. You agree people aren’t owed anything, yet still argue they’re indebted based on circumstance. I know we see things differently, which is why I wanted you to address my last point—we might find common ground. I support your choice to have social safety nets, as I value freedom and optionality. But why then achieve it by ignoring others' consent? You had the opportunity to say you agree we should have a voluntary split where you contribute to this system and I dont, and to leave my apparent 'woes' of not 'benefitting' from that safety-net system to me. That way I get what I want and you get what you want. I will own my downfall if needs be, it isnt any of you concern nor a point in your favour as to why I must be compelled to contribute to your system. 
  But I know why no one cedes this conclusion because you cant get social safey nets if there's no one to leech off of.
  
  I'll leave with this powerful quote about people being parasites
"..even with all the power to prevent social consequences, and even if that guy would never have traded with you anyway. 
A man who sustains himself by means of aggression is destroying the root of his own sustenance. He is made wholly dependent on the virtues of others while acting to destroy those virtues. He has defaulted on his own existence, counting on the choices of others to keep him alive. He is forced to deal on their terms to keep them afloat. With all the power to control others, the power to control his own life has disappeared."


```1. "What gives someone authority over another individual to ignore their consent?" - Government is a body of people that are *typically* elected to pass laws and make decisions on OUR behalf.  Therefore, by participating in the economy (buying, selling goods and working), you are CONSENTING to taxation - if you don't like it, you are free to go live in the jungle, as I've said.
2. "How can you not wrap your brain around the fact that if I don’t comply, I go to jail?" - You would only go to jail if you CHOOSE to participate in only the aspects that benefit you, but then not participate in things you don't like. - so again you are FREE to go and live in a jungle. If you are not earning monetary income, NO government can send you to jail for not paying taxes. I'm sure you are aware there are indigenous tribes throughout the world - they don't pay taxes to any government because they do not participate in the wider economy.
3. "If they object, I throw them in a cage" - as long as they have a CHOICE to leave your plantation, then there's nothing wrong; if they choose to stay under those conditions, that is their choice. However, if they have no choice on whether they can leave, then THAT is slavery.
4. "The false options you present is that one must either live alone or stay and let the govt dictate their lives" - it is not a false option, YOU want to have it both ways. And by no means am I saying you need to live alone. Find like-minded people and start your own version of society with no taxation. But if we accept that there will need to be a government, that government needs to be funded one way or another.
5. "that’s where I am choosing to go to a country that will be less invasive" - so you are basically trading one "slave" plantation for another. The mere fact that you can do that literally means no one is forcing you; therefore, it is not slavery.
```

1. That could NEVER be consent, you're trying to contort that situation into consent but it fails on all grounds. The definition of **consent** is **the voluntary agreement or permission for something to happen**. It typically involves **clear, informed, and willing approval** without coercion or pressure. My birth and existence onto some land !== consent. If so then all kids born onto a plantation would be 'consenting' to slavery. So I could understand a voter being someone who consents but I've never voted. So I didnt pick these people, but somehow it means I consented? Could this logic be used for rape? 
2. The govt !== economy they partake like the rest of us this isnt communism. Earning money through voluntary actions in order to live isnt consent to be stolen from either — what if i get paid in BTC not TTD (akin to living in a jungle) and then they decide to tax that, am I magically now consenting lol? — All in all this does qualify in the slightest as consent
3. This is wild mental gymnastics to say anyone in an aggressed upon situation has a legitimate 'choice': so someone kidnaps your dog and holds it ransom, you would say that you have a legitimate choice in that situation — that if you 'chose' not to pay the ransom and the kidnappers killed your dog, its actually your fault?
4. This is such a bad outlook, to down tools and say it will always be like that. Imagine if the first abolitionists gave up like this — based on how you view govt being THE say-so youd side with keeping slavery legal cuz you havent shown explicitly why they differ, you just say govt says so by fiat/or people trading in society etc, and there's benefits you like — all of which would be present in those times as well making them pro-slavery arguments if we thought like that.
   I do accept there will be a need for governance and Im glad you agree it can be funded *another way* — i.e. the same way any private business is funded by voluntary trade. Id imagine the moral outrage youd have if Apple showed up with guns and demanded payments from its iphone users to "better the product" — yet if the govt does citing the same rationale it its magically okay
5. First based take so far, YES, I am moving to a better slave plantation with 0 help from anyone who runs the current plantation — its actually a pain to leave since this gracious govt cant do basic things in a timely manner vs my bank (private org) for example, gee I wonder why?. If all this hoop jumping I have to do constitutes as "not slavery" then the fact that slaves could runaway like the moors in Haiti meant that they had a "choice" according to you right? So all the other slaves in the other islands werent actually slaves cuz they chose not to runaway — see how absurd this sounds?
