A and B are implied that they benefitted from public services
Both attend uni
Both are gainfully employed
They are taxed (seemingly rationale since the education was for them to get into the job market)
A through his own actions self-improved and now earns double
B stagnants
Why should A being paying more in taxes when both A and B reached the goal of gainful employment and were taxed for making it there
Should A not improve since there is no burden that B should also be as successful?
How is this system expected to work?
