Anarcho-capitalists synthesise these two observations:

1. The state is a moral evil, as it uses aggression to achieve its ends. Any organization which does not do this would not qualify as a state.
   eg. WalmartCorp provides groceries + internet/mobile data plans + electricity + plumbing but requires a membership/subscription fee.
2. A free market economy is the natural conclusion of extending the [[The Non-aggression Principle]] into economics. Furthermore, it is the *most* value-productive economic arrangement as opposed to other arrangements which involve varying degrees of [[Central Planning]] which all suffer from the [[Economic Calculation Problem]]. These are the logical conclusions of [[Austrian Economics]] _i.e._ Economics

Worse case scenario is a "state" forming (near impossible) [[Anarcho-Capitalism deters state formation]]
