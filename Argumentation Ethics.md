1. All claims/propositions during an argument are to be justified/denied, i.e. find its truth value (true or false)
2. Doing the opposite of argumentation is violence (aggression), which does not resolve any truth value from any dispute.
```
eg. I see 2 men fighting over a widget
If I decide to just shoot one of them, I have a 50/50 chance of killing the wrong person. This also means whether I kill the right guy or not, I have not found the truth in that dispute, as in me killing one of them does not in itself give me the answer as to who is the rightful owner of the widget.

It is only after through argumentation, presumably through police/courts that it is found that I killed the right or wrong guy.

---

This is universal for any conflict or dispute, it is impossible to find truth with aggression.

```
3. Argumentation therefore presupposes non-aggression, and any attempt to argue the opposite claim, uses the presupposition of non-aggression to do so which is a performative contradiction. Since if you owned the person why would you need to convince him at all?.
```
NB - successfully convincing someone it is okay to aggress does not refute anything as the contradiction exists whether you accept it or not. i.e. 2+2=4 regardless if you convince someone 2+2=3. This is because consciousness does not equal reality ([[Primacy of Consciousness]]) but rather reality precedes consciousness ([[Primacy of Existence]])
```

#### Self-ownership (Basis for Capitalism)
This presupposition of non-aggression in argumentation logically extends to the right to self-ownership. 
i.e. choosing to argue (a conflict free action), with an interlocutor (a person in talks with), acknowledges that he is the sole owner of himself his as you are necessarily respecting that boundary in your engagement with him through peaceful means. (argumentation is conflict free).
