Hans-Hermann Hoppe's argument from argument
i.e. _Can you logically justify aggression towards someone?_
1. argumentation is and must be a _conflict-free_ interaction used to derive truth values - arguing otherwise results in an obvious contradiction _([[Law of Non-Contradiction]])_
2. the opposite of argumentation would be aggression (conflict initiation) is [[The Law of the Jungle]] which succumbs to the the fallacy of the [[Primacy of Consciousness]]
3. arguing for aggression in particular, presupposes the norm of _non-aggression_ as argumentation is a _conflict-free_ interaction meaning this argument is a performative contradiction _([[Law of Non-Contradiction]])_
   This is akin to saying, _"I ought not speak"_ or _"People are always indifferent to things"_ or _"We ought not argue"_ - the very act of proposing these propositions, presupposes the very **opposite** of the claim being made therefore contradicting oneself and thus being false _([[Law of Non-Contradiction]])_
4. furthermore from argumentation we get property-rights, as to deny this in argumentation would be to presuppose one's _self-ownership_ as well as the interlocutor's _(why else would you need to engage with him if you owned him? clearly you do not and cannot)_ 
   This means any argument against property rights is as though it is not presupposed all while presupposing it. It is precisely through argumentation we know that property-rights exists.

### Walkthrough of Aggression's Contradiction
   To elaborate further, an argument in favour of aggression is an argument in which the attempt is to show that why we may aggress against others to _divvy up scarce resources_. 
   Walking through this argument, we can see the contradiction more clearly as it is essentially saying the following:
   1. I think we should aggress towards people in particular situations to figure out who gets what
   2. I recognize that using aggression towards you **cannot** convince you that aggression is a valid means of divvying up resources
       i.e. hitting you/robbing you/threatening you cannot prove anything to you, meaning as a method of deriving truth values it is `FALSE`
   3. So I will use aggression" (aggression prime), a conflict-free method (argumentation), to prove that aggression is okay, meaning argumentation as method of deriving truth values is `TRUE`
   4. Contradiction: aggression cannot be known to be false in deriving truth values and also be claimed to be true

### Misconceptions as _Counterarguments_
- ##### _AE only applies during the course of an argument_
  If conclusions reached in argumentation only matter during the course of the argumentation then that would apply to all conclusions. Meaning an argument showing 2+2=4 only matters in that instance and outside of argumentation we can believe it is it 3 or 5 or 7. This argument itself falls on its own grounds — _that conclusions of arguments only matter in argumentation_, meaning that its argument is as worthless as its claim itself. Furthermore, this argument broadly speaking would be the complete abdication of truth itself making this an outright false _counterargument_.
  
- ##### _AE only applies to the body parts required for an argument_
  The second counterargument is that argumentation ethics only prevents violence towards the body parts that one is using in the course of an argument. That it may be true, that one would contradict himself by cutting his interlocutors tongue out, but would not by breaking his legs. This counterargument completely misses the mark in that Hoppe’s argument is not about which body parts are being used, its about solving the dispute through peaceful rather than violent means (argumentation **is and must be** a conflict-free interaction). Therefore it is certainly true that breaking a man's legs is violent, but this is an impermissible move in an argument.
  
### Other notes
The argument from argument gives us "truth values" — we ought not aggress, this is not derived from some apodictically true axiom, it is not analytically true, but rather dialectically true which is another objective foundation for truth. 
In the same way parallel lines are 2 lines that never meet is not analytically true — we did not go out into nature and measure all the line possibilities to see prove it, but rather its definition holds true by its logical construction of what makes these lines parallel.
So in closing, any ethic that allows for even a smidge of aggression is contradictory and thus false.
