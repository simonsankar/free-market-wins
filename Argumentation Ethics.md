i.e. _Can you logically justify aggression towards someone?_
1. argumentation is and must be a _conflict-free_ interaction - arguing otherwise results in an obvious contradiction _([[Law of Non-Contradiction]])_
2. the opposite of argumentation would be aggression (conflict initiation) is [[The Law of the Jungle]] which succumbs to the the fallacy of the [[Primacy of Consciousness]]
3. arguing for aggression in particular, presupposes the norm of _non-aggression_ as argumentation is a _conflict-free_ interaction meaning this argument is a performative contradiction _([[Law of Non-Contradiction]])_
   This is akin to saying, _"I ought not speak"_ or _"People are always indifferent to things"_ or _"We ought not argue"_ - the very act of proposing these propositions, presupposes the very **opposite** of the claim being made therefore contradicting oneself and thus being false _([[Law of Non-Contradiction]])_
4. furthermore from argumentation we get property-rights, as to deny this in argumentation would be to presuppose one's _self-ownership_ as well as the interlocutor's _(why else would you need to engage with him if you owned him? clearly you do not and cannot)_ 
   This means any argument against property rights is as though it is not presupposed all while presupposing it

   To elaborate further, an argument in favour of aggression is an argument which the attempt is to show that why we may aggress against others to divvy up scarce resources. 
   Walking through this argument, we can see the contradiction more clearly as it is essentially saying the following in a cyclical manner
   1. I think we should aggress towards people in particular situations to figure out who gets what
   2. I recognize that using aggression towards you cannot convince you that aggression is okay i.e. hitting you/robbing you/threatening you cannot prove anything to you
   3. So I will use a conflict-free method (argumentation) to prove that aggression is okay
   4. Back to no. 1.
