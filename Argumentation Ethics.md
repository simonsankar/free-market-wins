i.e. _Can you logically justify aggression towards someone?_
1. argumentation is and must be a _conflict-free_ interaction - arguing otherwise results in an obvious contradiction _([[Law of Non-Contradiction]])_
2. the opposite of argumentation would be aggression (conflict initiation) is [[The Law of the Jungle]] which succumbs to the the fallacy of the [[Primacy of Consciousness]]
3. arguing for aggression in particular, presupposes the norm of _non-aggression_ as argumentation is a _conflict-free_ interaction meaning this argument is a performative contradiction _([[Law of Non-Contradiction]])_
   This is akin to saying, _"I ought not speak"_ or _"People are always indifferent to things"_ or _"We ought not argue"_ - the very act of proposing these propositions, presupposes the very **opposite** of the claim being made therefore contradicting oneself and thus being false _([[Law of Non-Contradiction]])_
4. furthermore from argumentation we get property-rights, as to deny this in argumentation would be to presuppose one's _self-ownership_ as well as the interlocutor's _(why else would you need to engage with him if you owned him? clearly you do not and cannot)_ 
   This means any argument against property rights is as though it is not presupposed all while presupposing it
