## Repository Overview

This is an Obsidian vault containing philosophical and economic writings focused on Austrian economics, libertarian philosophy, and anarcho-capitalist arguments. The content is organized as markdown files with Obsidian linking conventions.

## Repository Structure

- **Root directory**: Contains primary philosophical and economic concept files (e.g., `Anarchism.canvas`, `Austrian Economics.md`, `Markets.md`, `Taxation.md`)
- **essays/**: Longer-form argumentative essays and detailed analyses on key topics
- **zingers/**: Short, punchy arguments and one-liners on various topics
- **3rd world govt woes/**: Critiques of government policies and interventions, particularly focused on local examples
- **.obsidian/**: Obsidian vault configuration (do not modify)
- **.smart-env/**: Smart environment configuration (do not modify)

## Content Guidelines

- Files use Obsidian markdown with double-bracket linking syntax: `[[Topic Name]]`
- Content focuses on dismantling pro-aggression ethics and promoting free market principles
- Writing style is direct and argumentative, often using humor and strong language
- Files typically contain concise arguments rather than lengthy treatises

## Key Topics Covered

## Working with This Repository

When editing or creating content:
- Maintain the philosophical consistency with libertarian/anarcho-capitalist principles
- Use Obsidian's linking syntax for cross-references
- Keep individual files focused on specific concepts or arguments
- Follow the existing tone and style (direct, argumentative, occasionally humorous)
- Ensure arguments are grounded in Austrian economic principles or natural rights theory

## File Organization

- Concept files: Direct philosophical or economic topics
- Critique files: Arguments against statist policies or interventions  
- Supporting files: Canvas files for visual concept mapping
- Directory organization reflects thematic groupings rather than strict hierarchies

The repository serves as a comprehensive knowledge base for libertarian economic and philosophical arguments, structured for easy navigation and cross-referencing within Obsidian.
