**"Consciousness is the faculty of awareness—the faculty of perceiving that which exists."**

## The Axiom

Consciousness is the faculty of perceiving that which exists. It is not a passive state but an active process of identification. Consciousness is always consciousness OF something - it requires an object. A consciousness conscious of nothing but itself is a contradiction in terms.

Key principle: **To be conscious is to be conscious of something**

## Nature of Consciousness

Consciousness is:
- **Identification**: The process of grasping what exists
- **Relational**: Always involves a subject (the conscious being) and an object (what one is conscious of)
- **Active**: Not passive reception but active identification
- **Dependent on means**: Requires specific biological/physical apparatus

Consciousness is NOT:
- Self-sufficient (requires something to be conscious of)
- Creative of reality (it identifies, doesn't create)
- Infallible (capable of error in identification)
- Automatic (beyond sensory level, requires volitional focus)

## Levels of Consciousness

### Sensory Level
- Automatic response to stimuli
- Present in simple organisms
- No conceptual identification

### Perceptual Level  
- Integration of sensations into percepts
- Automatic in higher animals and humans
- Awareness of entities, not just sensations

### Conceptual Level
- Unique to humans (as far as we know)
- Volitional - requires chosen mental effort
- Forms concepts through abstraction
- Makes reasoning possible

## Primacy of Existence vs. Primacy of Consciousness

The crucial principle: **Existence has primacy over consciousness**

### [[Primacy of Existence]] (Correct)
- Existence exists independent of consciousness
- Consciousness must conform to existence
- Reality is what it is regardless of beliefs
- Wishing doesn't make it so

### [[Primacy of Consciousness]] (False)
- The fallacy that consciousness creates/controls reality
- Belief that reality conforms to consciousness
- Foundation of mysticism, subjectivism, relativism
- Self-refuting (whose consciousness has primacy?)

## Validation of Consciousness

Consciousness cannot be "proven" because any proof would require consciousness. Instead, it is an axiom - self-evident and undeniable:

**Any attempt to deny consciousness uses consciousness:**
- "Consciousness doesn't exist" - requires consciousness to formulate
- "Consciousness is an illusion" - illusions are states of consciousness
- "We're not really aware" - awareness needed to make the claim
- "It's all physical" - requires consciousness to grasp "physical"

## Consciousness and Free Will

Human consciousness at the conceptual level is volitional:
- We must choose to think
- We must choose to focus our awareness
- We can evade or drift
- This is the root of human [[Ethics]]

The choice to think or not to think is the fundamental choice that makes all other choices possible. This is why humans need morality - because we must choose our actions.

## Common Errors

**"Consciousness is just brain chemistry"**
This commits the fallacy of reductionism. Yes, consciousness requires a brain (in humans), but consciousness as experienced cannot be reduced to neural firings any more than a symphony can be reduced to air vibrations.

**"Consciousness creates reality"**
This is [[Primacy of Consciousness]] - refuted by the fact that reality doesn't conform to wishes. If consciousness created reality, whose consciousness? Why can't you wish away pain or create wealth by thinking?

**"We can't know if others are conscious"**
This is the "problem of other minds" - but it's a pseudo-problem. We observe that entities similar to us (other humans) act in ways consistent with consciousness. To demand Cartesian certainty about others' consciousness while accepting your own is arbitrary.

**"AI could be conscious"**
Current AI lacks the biological basis of consciousness. It processes information but doesn't have awareness. There's a fundamental difference between processing symbols and being aware of meaning.

## Consciousness and Knowledge

Consciousness makes knowledge possible:
- **Perception**: Direct awareness of existence
- **Conception**: Abstract identification of essentials
- **Logic**: Method of non-contradictory identification
- **Science**: Systematic conceptual knowledge

But consciousness is also fallible:
- Errors in perception (illusions)
- Errors in conception (invalid concepts)
- Errors in reasoning (logical fallacies)
- Errors in knowledge (false theories)

This is why we need a method of cognition - logic based on the [[Law of Non-Contradiction]].

## Foundation for Individual Rights

Consciousness - specifically rational consciousness - is the foundation of individual rights:

### [[Self-ownership]]
Because you possess rational consciousness, you own yourself. You are capable of directing your own life through chosen thinking and action.

### [[Argumentation Ethics]]
Arguments presuppose that the participants are conscious beings capable of grasping arguments. This validates property rights and non-aggression.

### Need for Freedom
Because human consciousness is volitional and fallible, humans need freedom to think, judge, and act. This leads to [[The Non-aggression Principle]].

## Consciousness and Economics

Consciousness is central to economics:
- **Value**: Only conscious beings can value
- **Choice**: Economics studies chosen human action
- **Knowledge**: The [[Knowledge Problem]] exists because consciousness is individual
- **Calculation**: The [[Economic Calculation Problem]] exists because values are held by individual consciousnesses

## The Axiom's Invulnerability

Like all axioms, consciousness cannot be denied without self-contradiction. As explored in [[Axioms as Invulnerable]], any denial of consciousness must use consciousness, thereby affirming it.

The three axioms - [[Existence]], [[Identity]], and Consciousness - form an indivisible trinity:
- Existence is what consciousness is conscious of
- Identity is what consciousness identifies
- Consciousness is the faculty that grasps existence and identity

Together, they form the foundation of all knowledge, making possible logic, science, ethics, and ultimately human flourishing through voluntary cooperation.
