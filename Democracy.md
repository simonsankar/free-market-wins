## What It Is

Democracy: A system where collective decisions are made by majority vote, typically through elected representatives.

The foundational claim is that **legitimacy derives from popular consent** - "the will of the people" expressed through voting.

In practice: 51% of voters get to impose their preferences on the other 49% through state enforcement.

## Why It's Just Tyranny With Extra Steps

Democracy doesn't change the fundamental nature of the state. It's still:
- **Monopoly on violence** in a geographic area
- **Funded by coercion** (taxation)
- **Imposed on dissenters** whether they "consent" or not

The only difference from other forms of government is **who gets to decide** which aggression to commit.

Monarchy: One person decides
Oligarchy: Small group decides
Democracy: Majority decides

All three violate [[The Non-Aggression Principle]]. Democracy just diffuses responsibility so thoroughly that no one feels accountable.

## The Consent Myth

**"But people vote, so they consent!"**

No. Voting is choosing your preferred master. That's not consent to the system - it's participation in self-defense.

If 10 people vote on whether to rob you, and you vote "no," did you consent to being robbed when the majority votes "yes"? Of course not.

**"If you don't like it, leave!"**

This assumes the state legitimately owns the territory. But states acquired their land through conquest, not homesteading. Why should you have to leave property you justly acquired just because a majority claims jurisdiction over it?

**"Social contract!"**

Never signed. Never agreed to. Unenforceable in any court. Not a contract by any meaningful definition.

You can't have a legitimate contract that:
- Binds people who never agreed to it
- Binds future generations who weren't alive to consent
- Has no exit clause
- Is enforced by one party's violence

That's not a contract. That's extortion with paperwork.

## Why Majority Rule Isn't Legitimate

**No objective decision procedure:** What if 51% vote to enslave the 49%? Genocide? Confiscation of all property?

Democracy provides **no principled limit** on what the majority can do. Every attempt to impose limits (constitutions, bills of rights) gets reinterpreted or ignored when convenient.

**Arbitrary threshold:** Why 51%? Why not 60%? 75%? Unanimous consent?

There's no logical reason. It's just **might makes right** with a popular veneer.

**Ignores intensity of preference:** 51% who mildly prefer A can overrule 49% whose lives depend on B. The system treats all preferences as equal in weight, which is economically illiterate.

## The Economic Problem: Voting Can't Calculate

Markets aggregate dispersed knowledge through prices. Every transaction reveals preference intensity (how much you're willing to pay/sacrifice).

Voting destroys this. Your vote for Candidate A reveals **nothing** about:
- How much you value their policies
- What you'd be willing to sacrifice for them
- What alternatives you'd accept

This is why democracies misallocate resources catastrophically. See [[Economic Calculation Problem]].

Politicians have no profit/loss mechanism to guide decisions. They respond to **concentrated interests** (who lobby) and **electoral optics** (who screams loudest), not actual economic value creation.

## Democracy in Practice: Incentive Nightmare

**Rational ignorance:** Your vote has ~0% chance of changing outcomes. So voters have no incentive to become informed. They vote based on vibes, propaganda, and team loyalty.

**Concentrated benefits, diffuse costs:** Politicians favor policies that benefit small, vocal groups (who donate/lobby) at the expense of everyone else (who don't notice individual costs).

Example: Tariffs benefit specific industries visibly. Costs spread across all consumers as invisible price increases. Democracy favors the tariff.

**Time preference destruction:** Politicians operate on 2-4 year election cycles. Long-term costs (debt, inflation, unfunded liabilities) are someone else's problem.

**Tragedy of the commons:** Everyone votes to extract resources from "the government" (really: other taxpayers). No one has incentive to restrain spending. Fiscal collapse is inevitable.

## What Democracy Really Is

Strip away the rhetoric and democracy is:

**A system where:**
- Majorities or pluralities vote to violate the rights of minorities
- Politicians trade other people's money for votes
- Diffuse responsibility ensures no one is accountable
- Economic calculation is impossible
- Rational ignorance guarantees bad decisions
- Time horizons are destroyed

**In other words:** Tyranny with better PR.

It doesn't matter if the mob votes to rob you. It's still robbery.

It doesn't matter if the majority wants to regulate your business into bankruptcy. It's still aggression.

It doesn't matter if a constitution permits it. Constitutions are interpreted by the state. The state will always rule in favor of more state power.

## The Alternative

[[Anarcho-Capitalism]] - Unanimous consent through voluntary exchange.

No voting on other people's rights.
No majority tyranny.
No diffused responsibility.
No economic calculation problem.

Just property rights, markets, and voluntary cooperation.

If you want a service, you pay for it. If you don't, you don't. No one gets to vote on what you must buy or fund.

Simple. Logical. Non-aggressive.

Everything democracy isn't.
