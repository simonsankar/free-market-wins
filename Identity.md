# Identity (The Second Axiom)

**"To exist is to be something, to possess identity. A thing is itself; or, in the traditional formula, A is A."**

## The Axiom

Identity is the fact that everything that exists has a specific nature. To exist is not to exist as an indeterminate nothing, but to exist as SOMETHING - with specific characteristics, attributes, and properties that make it what it is and not something else.

The classical formulation is: **A is A**

This means:
- A thing is what it is
- A thing acts according to its nature
- A thing cannot be itself and not itself simultaneously
- A thing cannot possess contradictory attributes in the same respect at the same time

## The Law of Identity in Detail

Every existent has:
- **Specific characteristics** that constitute its identity
- **Specific actions** it can and cannot perform
- **Specific relationships** it can enter into with other existents

Examples:
- Water at sea level boils at 100°C, not at any random temperature
- A stone falls when dropped, it doesn't float upward
- A human requires oxygen to survive, not methane
- 2 + 2 = 4, not 5 or 3 or any other number

## Foundation of Logic

The Law of Identity is the foundation of all logic and reasoning:

### Law of Non-Contradiction
From Identity follows: **¬(P ∧ ¬P)** - a proposition cannot be both true and false simultaneously. This is explored in detail in [[Law of Non-Contradiction]].

### Law of Excluded Middle  
Either P or ¬P must be true - there is no middle ground between a thing being itself and not being itself.

### All Valid Reasoning
Every logical argument depends on terms maintaining consistent identity throughout the argument. If A could be both A and not-A, no reasoning would be possible.

## Implications for Knowledge

Identity makes knowledge possible:
- **Concepts**: We can form concepts because things have specific identities we can categorize
- **Causality**: Things act according to their identity - same cause, same effect
- **Measurement**: We can measure because things have specific, stable characteristics
- **Science**: Natural laws are possible because things act according to their nature

## Relationship to Other Axioms

Identity is a corollary of [[Existence]]:
- To exist = to exist as something
- Existence without identity is impossible
- "Pure existence" without any characteristics is a contradiction

Identity is grasped by [[Consciousness]]:
- Consciousness identifies what exists
- The act of consciousness is the identification of identity
- To be conscious is to be conscious of something AS something

## Common Errors

**"Identity is just a human construct"**
No - humans IDENTIFY identity, we don't create it. A rock has specific characteristics whether humans exist to recognize them or not.

**"Things are constantly changing, so A is not A"**
Change is the alteration of identity OVER TIME. At any given moment, a thing is what it is. Ice becoming water doesn't violate identity - it means H₂O molecules at different temperatures have different properties.

**"Quantum mechanics proves identity doesn't apply"**
Quantum entities still have specific properties (mass, charge, spin). Uncertainty in measurement doesn't mean uncertainty in identity. Probabilistic behavior is still lawful behavior.

**"Eastern philosophy shows A can be not-A"**
Contradictions cannot exist in reality. Any claim that something both is and isn't simultaneously is either:
- Using terms in different senses
- Referring to different times
- Referring to different respects
- Simply false

## Foundation for Property Rights

Identity is crucial for [[Private Property]] and [[Ownership]]:
- Objects maintain their identity independent of possession
- Ownership is a relationship between a person (with identity) and objects (with identity)
- [[Self-ownership]] depends on humans having specific identity as rational beings

## Foundation for Ethics

Because humans have a specific identity as rational beings who must act to survive, ethics becomes possible:
- Humans have specific requirements for survival (food, shelter, freedom to think)
- Human actions have specific consequences based on the identity of reality
- Values are objective because they're based on the identity of human nature

This leads directly to [[The Non-aggression Principle]] - because humans have specific identity as rational beings who require freedom to act according to their judgment to survive.

## The Primacy of Identity

Nothing can violate its own identity:
- Contradictions cannot exist ([[Law of Non-Contradiction]])
- Wishes cannot alter facts ([[Primacy of Existence]])
- Things cannot act against their nature

This is why [[Socialism is impossible]] - it attempts to violate the identity of human nature and economic law.
