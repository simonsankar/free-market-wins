As the mechanism of [[Central Planning]] is to steal from the productive class to fund initiatives for the unproductive class, this warps the incentives for each class.
Instead of the unproductive class seeking to become members of the productive class, i.e. to become producers and not consumers, they seek to pursue more benefits from the productive class by way of state apparatus since it is easier than actually putting in work. "We want more free stuff from those rich guys".

This then creates pressure on the productive class as the leeches grow in number making the ambition to produce more less attractive since the will keep less and less of what they've earned. "Why work more if I'm not going to see it"

This is the clear parasitic nature of [[Central Planning]], where the unproductive class grows and the productive class shrinks. There is a lack of incentive for those benefiting from others to cease their leeching from their fellow man, instead the state continuously highlights the disparity to gain favour with the unproductive class so that it may steal more from the productive class.

This is a major contributing factor to brain-drain, by which productive people leave their countries to go to countries where their productivity is valued more than their home country.
