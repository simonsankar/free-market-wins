`¬(p ∧ ¬p)`
In plain terms, if `P` is `true`, `P` _cannot_ also be `false` meaning it is a contradiction.

Why is this important?
Let's say we want to achieve a high grade in Physics. If the best way to achieve a high grade in Physics is to study then _not_ studying with the expectation to achieve a high grade in Physics is necessarily going to fail in achieving the desired outcome.

To state the obvious, studying and achieving a high grade and _not_ studying and achieving a high grade cannot both be ways of achieving high grades since
