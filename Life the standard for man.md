# Life: The Standard for Man

All men prefer life than not. To prefer anything else necessitates preferring life.
Man cannot prefer death as it is a contradiction.

## The Logical Foundation

### The Inescapable Starting Point
Any discussion about human action, ethics, or economics must begin with the fact that humans choose to live. This isn't a moral prescription but a logical necessity - **you cannot argue for death while remaining alive to make the argument**.

The very act of:
- Making choices
- Having preferences  
- Engaging in discussion
- Pursuing goals

All presuppose that life is the standard. Even a nihilist arguing "life is meaningless" demonstrates through his continued existence that he values life enough to maintain it.

### The Performative Contradiction
To argue against life as the standard for man creates a performative contradiction:
- The argument requires being alive
- Making arguments implies life has value (your time, energy, thought)
- Attempting to convince others assumes their lives matter
- The very concept of "ought" requires an "is" - beings who exist

## Objectivist Foundation

From [[Axiom of Action]] and the nature of [[Identity]]:

### Life as the Root of Value
Values only exist for living beings. An inanimate object cannot value anything. Therefore:
- Life is the source of all values
- The choice to live generates the need for a code of values (ethics)
- What furthers life is good, what threatens it is bad
- This isn't arbitrary - it's derived from the nature of living beings

### Man's Specific Nature
Humans survive by reason, not instinct:
- Must discover what actions promote survival
- Must choose to think and act rationally
- Social cooperation enhances survival through [[Trade]]
- Individual rationality benefits all through voluntary exchange

## Austrian Economics Connection

### [[Human action]]
All economic activity stems from the desire to improve one's condition - ultimately to maintain and enhance life:
- People act to remove felt uneasiness
- Economic choices aim to secure better living conditions
- [[Production]] and [[Trade]] expand the possibilities for human flourishing
- [[Scarcity]] exists because man's time is finite and unknown

### [[Time]] Preference
Humans prefer satisfaction sooner rather than later because:
- Life is finite and uncertain
- Present satisfaction ensures continued existence
- Future planning requires being alive to enjoy the benefits
- Interest rates reflect life's urgency and uncertainty

## Ethical Implications

### Individual Rights
Because life is the standard:
- Each person owns their life ([[Self-ownership]])
- Initiation of force threatens the standard ([[The Non-aggression Principle]])
- [[Private Property]] protects the means of sustaining life
- Voluntary exchange respects each person's life choices

### Social Cooperation
Life as the standard makes cooperation rational:
- Others' lives matter because all humans share the same standard
- Mutual benefit through trade enhances everyone's survival
- Specialization and division of labor multiply human capabilities
- Peace and prosperity result from respecting life as the universal standard

## Confronting Anti-Life Ideologies

### The Environmental Contradiction
When environmentalists argue humans should reduce activity, consume less, or limit population for "the planet's sake," they commit a fundamental error:

**The Contradiction**: They use human reason, human values, and human communication to argue against human flourishing. But:
- Who values "the environment" if not humans?
- For whom is environmental protection good if not living beings?
- What gives non-conscious nature any value without conscious beings to value it?

### The Population Myth
"Overpopulation" arguments assume human life is a burden rather than a benefit:
- More humans = more minds to solve problems
- More humans = more hands to create wealth
- More humans = more cooperation and specialization
- The limit is not resources but the freedom to use human reason and creativity

### Climate Change Authoritarianism
When climate activists demand reduced human activity:
- They're arguing human life should be constrained for non-human ends
- They reject human reason in favor of environmental determinism  
- They advocate central planning over individual choice
- They forget that only living humans can value a habitable environment

## The Ultimate Standard

Life is not just *a* value - it's the *source* of all values:

### For Individuals
- Life makes possible all other goods: love, knowledge, achievement, happiness
- Death ends all possibility of value
- Rational selfishness means pursuing life-enhancing values

### For Society  
- Economic systems succeed when they enhance human life
- Political systems are just when they protect human life
- Cultures thrive when they celebrate human achievement

### For Policy
- Any policy that reduces human flourishing violates the standard
- Regulations that prevent voluntary life-enhancing exchanges are anti-life
- [[Taxation]] and [[Socialism]] steal the means of life from producers

## Conclusion

Life as the standard for man isn't a subjective preference - it's the logical foundation of all human thought and action. Any philosophy, economic system, or political ideology that treats human life as subordinate to other concerns (environment, society, state, God) commits the fundamental error of placing the source of all values beneath derivative values.

This is why [[Austrian Economics]] and [[Anarcho-Capitalism]] are the only systems consistent with human nature - they recognize that individual human life is the irreducible primary value from which all other values derive. Everything else is just a sophisticated way of arguing that humans should sacrifice their lives for something less important than life itself.
