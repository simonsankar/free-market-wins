## The Foundation

The Non-Aggression Principle (NAP) is the cornerstone of libertarian ethics: **It is illegitimate to initiate force or fraud against persons or property.**

Not a suggestion. Not a preference. A **logical necessity** derived from [[Argumentation Ethics]].

## Why It's Not Negotiable

Any attempt to argue *against* the NAP requires argumentation. But argumentation presupposes:
- Mutual recognition of self-ownership (you control your body to speak/listen)
- Non-aggression (you're not being coerced into agreement)
- Property rights (exclusive control over scarce means - your vocal cords, the space you occupy)

**To argue the NAP is wrong is to invoke the NAP.** Performative contradiction.

You cannot coherently claim aggression is justified while engaging in peaceful argumentation. If aggression were legitimate, your opponent could simply punch you instead of responding to your argument.

## What Counts as Aggression?

**Aggression:** Initiating force/fraud against persons or property.

**Not aggression:**
- Defensive force against aggressors
- Exclusion from your property
- Refusing to trade/associate
- Competitive market behavior
- Pricing people out of access to your resources

**Examples:**

| Action | NAP Violation? | Why |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| Taxation | YES | Initiated force/threat of force to extract resources |
| Self-defense | NO | Response to aggression, not initiation |
| Homesteading unused land | NO | No prior legitimate claim exists |
| Pollution onto others' property | YES | Physical invasion of property without consent |
| Refusing to bake a cake | NO | Your property, your choice |
| Price gouging | NO | Voluntary exchange; no force involved |
| Fractional reserve banking | DEPENDS | If depositors consent to terms, no; if fraud, yes |

## Common Objections (And Why They Fail)

### "But what about emergencies? Steal bread to save starving child?"

Still aggression. Still logically illegitimate. The desperation doesn't change the logical status of the act.

More importantly: **Parasitic ethics can't answer the mirror.** How much theft is acceptable? Who decides? See [[The Alien Ultimatum - Why Parasitic Ethics Cannot Answer Their Own Hypotheticals]].

### "NAP leads to absurd outcomes like letting kids starve"

Confusion of **legitimacy** with **morality**. The NAP defines what's *illegitimate to forcibly prevent.* It doesn't exhaust ethics.

You can think someone is an asshole for not helping while still recognizing you can't *force* them to help without becoming an aggressor yourself.

### "Who enforces the NAP without a state?"

Market mechanisms: [[Private Defense Agencies]], [[Polycentric Law]], reputation systems, insurance, ostracism.

The question assumes enforcement requires monopoly. It doesn't. See [[Anarcho-Capitalism]].

### "Property rights are aggression against the propertyless"

No. Aggression is *initiation* of force. Homesteading unused resources initiates nothing. Excluding others from what you justly acquired through labor/trade initiates nothing.

The "propertyless" argument smuggles in the premise that all resources are collectively owned by default - which is itself an aggressive claim requiring force to impose. See [[Self-Ownership]].

## Why It Matters

The NAP isn't just a political principle. It's the only ethical framework that:
- Derives from logical necessity (argumentation ethics)
- Doesn't self-destruct in performative contradiction
- Provides objective boundaries for interpersonal conflict
- Allows for genuine diversity (no forced uniformity)
- Scales without arbitrary power struggles

Everything else reduces to **might makes right** dressed in philosophical language.

Democracy? Tyranny of the majority.
Utilitarianism? Arbitrary victim sacrifice.
Social contract? Never signed, unenforceable fiction.
Divine command? Whose god? Enforced how?

Only the NAP stands on logical bedrock. Everything else is politics pretending to be ethics.
