Polylogism is the doctrine that there is not one correct logic, one correct method of reasoning necessarily binding on all men, but that there are many logics, each valid for some men and invalid for the others. The polylogist divides men into groups, and holds that each group has by nature (or creates for itself by choice) its own distinctive method of inference based on its own distinctive logical laws, so that the inferences that are entirely logical for one group are entirely illogical for the others

The truth is that man is man, and he is what he isâ€”a man is just as much as man as is his fellow man. Classifications of man must apply to all men, as opposed to this arbitrary subjectivism, which seeks to divide men arbitrarily. It is a clear fallacy that can be easily dismissed. If you qualify as a member of the human race, then you have the same basic equal nature insofar as you exist, therefore, you must operate on the same universal human ethic that applies to your nature.
