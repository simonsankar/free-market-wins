This is an inversion of the [[Primscacy of Existence]]. 
That existence that conforms to your consciousness, rather than the other way around.

The concept of “consciousness” however, requires a prior concept of _existence_. 
It is simply meaningless to speak of consciousness as floating on its own as it begs the question, what are you conscious of? 
There can be no consciousness without _things_ existing in the first place.
So in order to have consciousness is to be conscious _of something_, that something being reality.
Therefore reality must have primacy over consciousness **not** the other way around.
