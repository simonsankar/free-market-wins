The primacy of existence (of reality) is the axiom that existence exists.
This existence is independent of consciousness, things are what they are, they possess an identity. `A is A`
This implies that logic exists.

The rejection of this is called the [[Primacy of Consciousness]] which is a stolen concept since in order to be conscious, is to be conscious of something i.e. _of reality_, therefore reality must have primacy.

It is also impossible to deny the conclusions made as this concept rests upon (core) [[Axioms as Invulnerable]]
