1. A complete dismantlement of **any** pro-aggression law ethic _(democracy/Marxism/consequentialism/etc)_\
   _the logical justification of the NAP_ ðŸŒŸ
2. Showing that even if we take these failed ethics seriously they **all** objectively fail economically\
   _* laughs in ECP (economic calculation problem) *_ ðŸ¤£
3. Berate all centrally planned, 'moral outrage', altruistic, bullshit economic policies that are promoted by these failed ethics\
   _bbut... muh healthcare! muh roads! muh social safety net!_ ðŸ¤¡
4. How the free market wins!\
   _The reigning, defending, undefeated, undisputed, heavyweight champion of the world, Capitalism!!_ ðŸ‘‘
