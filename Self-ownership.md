The prerequisite to [[argumentation]] is property rights in oneself. You must first have exclusive control over the scarce means that which is yourself (mind, body etc).
Arguing against this obviously results in an obvious contradiction as it presupposes that you in fact **do not** and **can not**, own your interlocutor. i.e. have [[ownership]] over him.
