Socialism is the institutionalized policy of property title redistribution. It necessitates the violation of individuals self-sovereignty, in that a portion of their private-property is taken from them to fund ventures they do not consent to. The individual is therefore reduced to a tool for someone else's benefit.
This is percentage-based slavery since individuals do not keep all what they earn.

Because of the need for [[Aggression]] in socialism, we know it to be false.
