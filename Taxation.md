Taxation is the involuntary redistribution of capital
Since it is involuntary, it is by definition, an inferior use of this capital as the previous owner (taxee), had to be coerced against into giving it up. Otherwise he would've voluntarily traded it for a better good. 

The reason we can say it is an inferior use, is the fact that value is subjective (ordinal), and trade only happens when both parties expect to achieve a higher value than the thing they are giving up. Trade cannot occur if one party believes the trade will not benefit him, i.e. he will receive less value.

Taxation affects all actors in an economy which means every individual's taxes are by definition a misallocation of resources, ([[Socialism is impossible]]).
