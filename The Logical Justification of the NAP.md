The standard value for man **is** life
	- _man must act_  -> [[Axiom of Action]] (in order to live)
	- or not act (also an action, results in death)
Therefore if he does not want to die, his actions must necessarily be towards this standard of life.

Man's time however is scarce, i.e. he has a limit on how long he lives, therefore everything else becomes scarce since he do not have the enough time to do everything regardless if resources are _infinite_.

This scarcity means man will run into [[Conflicts]] i.e. I want to use A and you also want to use A, both cannot happen, it is a contradiction â€” a conflict. 
Law answers how we should deal with these conflicts and there are 3 basic ways to approach them.
1. conflicts _should not_ be avoided ([[The Law of the Jungle]])
2. conflicts should be avoided under certain circumstances, _but not always_ ([[Mixed Law]])
3. conflicts _should_ be avoided ([[The Non-aggression Principle]])

Both 1 & 2 succumb to being reduced to the [[Primacy of Consciousness]] fallacy and can be discarded as illogical ethics.

#### Argument from argument
We also notice that both 1 & 2 at their core is an attempt to justify some form [[Aggression]]. 
Through, [[Argumentation Ethics]] we know that justifying aggression in argumentation is contradictory meaning all law that permits a single form of aggression is resoundingly false.

Let A be [[Aggression]] which we know is `false`
Therefore ~A is Non-[[Aggression]] is `true`
