We grant the state a monopoly on violence, i.e. ultimate power, the ability to decide how to redistribute resources (who to aggress towards). So given that they have ultimate power and we do not, how are they limited or to be limited? How can a lesser faction limit the power of a bigger faction if the lesser faction cedes its power to the bigger faction?
