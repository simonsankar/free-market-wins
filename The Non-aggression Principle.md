In a world with scarce means and resources with infinite wants, conflicts occur. 
(This is also true for the garden of Eden since despite having infinite resources, one cannot be in the same space and time as another so conflicts still occur)
```
eg.
Crusoe and Friday on and island
Crusoe is spear fishing with a stick
Friday wants the stick to stoke his fire
CONFLICT arises
```

With respect to **all** conflicts, aggression is inherently illegitimate and arguing against it is contradictory.

This is proven with [[Argumentation Ethics]]
This is because argumentation presupposes non-aggression and the attempt to argue otherwise is therefore a performative contradiction. 
i.e. _Arguing_ that argumentation does not presuppose non-aggression precisely proves that arguing must in fact presuppose non-aggression because you are arguing which cannot be an aggressive action.
