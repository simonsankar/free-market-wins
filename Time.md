The most scarce resource. Because man's time is scarce and _unknown_, he can never achieve all his wants which invariably makes all other resources finite.

_Matter in the universe is finite but on a scale so large it is practically infinite. We are like an ant colony in a mega grocery store. We are limited in not the amount of goods available for us to procure but by the time we have to procure them_
