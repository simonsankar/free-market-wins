Easy answer: Aggression is false
The false idea marxists have is that workers do not get paid their _'fair share'_ under capitalism because profits go to the capitalist.

This is a straight up entitlement claim on someone else's property with no basis.
-  The capitalist had to forgo consumption to get the capital required to start the business.
- The worker is paid an agreed upon wage, even before they are productive in any meaningful capacity and regardless if any profits come in, _(talk about how greedy/selfish the capitalist is huh)_
- The capitalist alone, incurs all the risk, if things go south, would the worker also want loss sharing as well? i.e. work for no or less money?

Once again, it's all about abolishing [[private property]] which is aggression towards an individual which we know to be false through  [[The Non-aggression Principle]] that is backed by [[Argumentation Ethics]] and further by the [[Primacy of Existence]]
