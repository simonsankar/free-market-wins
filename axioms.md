# Axioms

**Axioms** are self-evident truths that don't need proof. They're the foundation from which all logical arguments must be built. You can't argue against an axiom without using it in your argument - making your position self-refuting.

## Why Axioms Matter

Every philosophy, economic system, and moral framework rests on certain axioms. The problem is that most people never examine their foundational assumptions. They build elaborate theories on rotten foundations.

In libertarian philosophy, we start with axioms that are:
- **Self-evident** - obvious to anyone with reason
- **Undeniable** - you can't argue against them without assuming them
- **Universal** - they apply to all humans at all times

## Core Libertarian Axioms

### 1. Self-Ownership
You own yourself. Your body, your mind, your actions - they belong to you, not to others or society. If you don't own yourself, then who does? And what gives them that right?

### 2. Non-Aggression Principle (NAP)
It's wrong to initiate force against peaceful people. Notice this doesn't say "force is always wrong" - it says *initiating* force is wrong. Self-defense is perfectly justified.

### 3. Property Rights
If you mix your labor with unowned resources, you own the result. How else could anyone legitimately own anything? All [[Property]] ultimately traces back to someone taking unowned resources and improving them.

### 4. Voluntary Exchange
Peaceful trade between consenting adults is always morally legitimate. Both parties benefit or they wouldn't trade. No third party has the right to interfere.

## How to Test an Axiom

A true axiom passes the **performative contradiction test**. Try to argue against it - you'll find yourself assuming the very thing you're trying to deny.

**Example**: Try to argue that self-ownership is false. You're using your mouth, your brain, your vocal cords to make the argument. But if you don't own yourself, you're stealing the use of someone else's body to make your point. You've contradicted yourself.

## Why Statists Hate Axioms

[[The State]] can't exist if people accept these axioms. Every government action violates at least one of them:

- **Taxation** violates self-ownership (your labor) and property rights
- **Regulation** violates voluntary exchange and the NAP
- **Conscription** violates self-ownership absolutely

This is why statists prefer to argue from consequences ("but who will build the roads?") rather than principles. They can't win on principles because their position is axiomatically impossible.

## The Foundation of [[Austrian Economics]]

These axioms form the logical foundation for Austrian economic theory. From self-ownership and voluntary exchange, we derive:

- **Subjective value theory** - only individuals can determine what things are worth to them
- **Economic calculation** - only [[Markets]] can coordinate human action efficiently  
- **Anti-interventionism** - government interference violates the axioms

## Conclusion

Start with correct axioms and you'll reach correct conclusions. Start with false assumptions and you'll justify evil. Most political and economic confusion stems from people accepting contradictory axioms without realizing it.

The beauty of libertarian axioms is their simplicity: Don't hurt people and don't take their stuff. Everything else follows from there.
