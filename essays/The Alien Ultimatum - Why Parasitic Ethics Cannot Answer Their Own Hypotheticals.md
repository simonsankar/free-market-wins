## The Asymmetry: What Each Framework Actually Tests

Ancaps get asked: **"Aliens will destroy Earth unless you steal a penny. Will you violate the NAP?"**

The question tests: **Will you violate consent at all?**

Ancap answer: **No.** Not preference. Logical necessity from axioms (self-ownership, property rights, NAP).

But here's the fatal mistake when "flipping" this hypothetical:

Asking statists to **stop** violating consent for 24 hours isn't a mirror test. **Their entire framework operates on consent violation.** Taxation, central planning, redistribution - all built on coercion.

The real mirror asks: **How MUCH consent violation is justified?**

## The Actual Statist Test: Quantifying the Acceptable Horror

**"Aliens will cure all disease and end scarcity IF you sacrifice 1 million starving children. Do you do it?"**

This is the functional equivalent because:
- Ancaps test **minimal consent violation** (one penny of theft)
- Statists must test **degree of consent violation** (since they already coerce)

Now watch what happens:

### If They Say Yes

They admit willingness to mass murder for consequences. But then why pretend to care about human welfare? Just say you worship power and outcomes, not people.

### If They Say No

**Why not?** Their policies already sacrifice people:
- Taxation kills via poverty and resource misallocation
- Prohibition kills via black markets and untreated addiction
- Inflation destroys savings and causes starvation in poorer nations
- Central planning creates famines (Holodomor, Great Leap Forward, etc.)

What's the objective threshold? 1 million dead is too much, but the millions already dying from statist policy are acceptable? **On what basis?**

### If They Can't Answer

They expose that parasitic ethics have **no objective decision procedure.** They rely on:

- **Democracy** → Majority whim (51% could vote yes or no arbitrarily)
- **Utilitarianism** → Arbitrary utility calculus (who decides 1M deaths < curing all disease?)
- **Marxist theory** → Vanguard whim (Party could rationalize either answer)
- **Technocracy** → Expert whim (experts will disagree on risk assessment)

**No matter which mechanism they pick, it reduces to whim-worship.** There's no axiomatic foundation to derive a guaranteed answer.

## What This Reveals: Parasitic Ethics Cannot Function

This isn't just about hypotheticals. It exposes the core incoherence:

**Statist ethics claim to be consequentialist but cannot justify which consequences matter or when.**

They already accept mass death from their policies (taxation, central planning, prohibition). So what's the principled difference between:
- The millions dying from state intervention NOW
- The 1 million they'd sacrifice for alien utopia

**There is none.** They just pretend current deaths don't count because those are "necessary" or "complicated."

But by what standard? Who decides? The majority? Experts? The Party?

Every answer reduces to **arbitrary power.** Whoever controls the mechanism controls the threshold for acceptable violence.

## Why the Ancap Answer Is Guaranteed (And Theirs Isn't)

**Ancap ethics:** Derived from axioms (self-ownership, property, NAP). Cannot be denied without performative contradiction. The answer to "will you violate consent?" is always **No** - not because we calculated outcomes, but because the question demands logical impossibility.

**Statist ethics:** No axioms. Only competing claims about "the good" with no objective grounding. The answer to "how much violation is acceptable?" depends entirely on **who has power** at the moment of decision.

One is logic. The other is politics.

## The Real Test

Forget aliens. The hypothetical already exists in reality:

**Your government policies kill people through poverty, prohibition, inflation, and war. How many deaths justify your desired outcomes?**

Statists can't answer because they have no objective threshold. They just gesture at "democracy" or "expert consensus" - mechanisms that are themselves arbitrary and contested.

Meanwhile, ancaps have a clear answer: **Zero aggression is justified.** Not because we worship suffering, but because consent violation is logically incoherent as an ethical foundation.

So next time someone asks if you'd steal a penny to save Earth, flip it:

**"You already steal billions and sacrifice millions. What's YOUR objective limit? Or do you just do whatever feels right?"**

They won't have an answer. Because parasitic ethics **cannot answer their own hypotheticals.**
