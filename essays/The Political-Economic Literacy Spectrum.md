## Overview: Understanding the Spectrum

This spectrum maps political and economic positions based on adherence to [[The Non-aggression Principle]] and economic literacy. It is **not** the traditional left-right spectrum, which Rothbard correctly identified as obsolete and misleading.

### The Core Framework

Following Hoppe's analysis in *A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism*:

**Capitalism** = Pure protection of [[Private Property]], free association, voluntary exchange. No exceptions. This is the institutionalized policy of non-aggression.

**Socialism** = All deviations from pure property protection. Any system that aggresses against property and contract. This includes everything from "democratic socialism" to full communism to "limited government" conservatism.

### The NAP: The Line in the Sand

[[The Non-aggression Principle]] serves as the demarcation line:

**ABOVE the line:** Positions that reject all institutionalized aggression (anarcho-capitalism in its forms)

**BELOW the line:** Positions that permit aggression in varying degrees and for various justifications - minarchism, democracy, conservatism, progressivism, socialism, communism, etc.

As proven by [[Argumentation Ethics]], the NAP is the only non-contradictory ethical position. Everything below this line is some form of [[Mixed Law]] - resolving conflicts by permitting aggression in arbitrary situations.

### Why Traditional Left-Right is Useless

Rothbard showed that the original spectrum was:
- **Left:** Voluntary association, free exchange, individual liberty
- **Right:** Hierarchy, compulsion, state power

Over time, state socialists claimed "the left" while free-market advocates were pushed right. This inversion obscures the real distinction: **degree of state aggression versus voluntary cooperation**.

### How to Use This Spectrum

1. **Mapping individuals:** Identify their positions on property rights, taxation, state power, NAP consistency
2. **Gauging populations:** Estimate distribution percentages to predict national trajectories
3. **Understanding contradictions:** Every position below NAP has logical contradictions
4. **Predicting outcomes:** Higher concentration of economic literacy = prosperity; higher concentration of parasitism = collapse

### Income Correlation Note

Income imperfectly correlates with position on this spectrum in relatively free markets. Why? Because income reflects value creation, which requires understanding cause-effect relationships that underpin economic literacy.

- **High earners who create value** (entrepreneurs, skilled specialists) skew heavily toward NAP-adjacent positions
- **High earners who extract value** (government contractors, lobbyists, DEI consultants) skew toward statism
- **Low earners** split between those trying to build (economically literate but low capital) and parasites (economically illiterate seeking redistribution)

The correlation isn't perfect, but it's reliable enough to be diagnostic.

---

## THE SPECTRUM: 12 Levels

---

## TIER 1: NAP-COMPLIANT (Above the Line)

These are the only positions that consistently reject institutionalized aggression. They recognize that any state, by definition, violates property rights through [[Taxation]] and monopolistic violence.

---

### Level 1: Rothbardian/Hoppean Anarcho-Capitalists

**Definition:** Pure anarcho-capitalism with zero tolerance for state aggression. Radical consistency with [[The Non-aggression Principle]]. All services currently provided by states - law, defense, dispute resolution - should be provided through voluntary market mechanisms.

**Core Philosophy:**
- [[Argumentation Ethics]] proves NAP is the only non-contradictory ethic
- [[Private Property]] established through [[Homesteading (First-comer Ethic)]], [[Production]], and [[Trade]]
- [[The State]] is an institution of aggression and must be abolished entirely
- [[Economic Calculation Problem]] proves central planning impossible
- All human interactions must be voluntary

**Positions:**
- Zero taxation (theft)
- No state monopoly on law/courts (private arbitration)
- No state military (private defense associations)
- No intellectual property (cannot own ideas, only scarce resources)
- No democracy (mob rule is still aggression)
- Sound money only (gold, [[Bitcoin]], market-chosen mediums)
- Closed borders are state property claims (invalid)

**Example Persons/Types:**
- Murray Rothbard
- Hans-Hermann Hoppe
- Stephan Kinsella
- Hardcore Bitcoin maximalists who grasp Austrian economics
- Principled agorists
- Entrepreneurial ancaps who've built businesses and rejected statism entirely

**Income Correlation:**
Highest variance. Includes:
- Successful entrepreneurs and tech founders ($200k+)
- Austrian economists and libertarian theorists ($80k-$150k)
- Young agorists building outside the system ($30k-$80k)
- Bitcoin early adopters (wide range)

**Contradictions:**
None. This is the only logically consistent position. All criticisms of anarcho-capitalism ultimately rely on accepting aggression as legitimate in certain situations, which is precisely what [[Argumentation Ethics]] proves false.

**Population %:** <0.1% globally (perhaps 500,000 - 1,000,000 people who genuinely hold this position consistently)

---

### Level 2: Pragmatic/Utilitarian Anarchists

**Definition:** Anarcho-capitalism arrived at through consequentialist reasoning rather than ethical axioms. They believe markets outperform states empirically, even if they're less committed to NAP as a moral absolute.

**Core Philosophy:**
- Markets are more efficient than states (true)
- Competition improves all services, including law and defense (true)
- Government intervention creates perverse incentives (true)
- Monopolies are bad, including government monopolies (true)
- But... may accept "necessary evils" or make pragmatic compromises

**Positions:**
- Generally anarcho-capitalist in practice
- May waver on edge cases (pollution, intellectual property, child rights)
- More willing to engage with political processes if they reduce state power
- Focus on outcomes over principles
- May support transition strategies that involve temporary statism

**Example Persons/Types:**
- Bryan Caplan-style consequentialist libertarians
- Effective altruists who happen to conclude anarcho-capitalism is optimal
- Former minarchists who were convinced by economic arguments
- Tech entrepreneurs who see government as inefficient competitor
- Seasteaders and charter city advocates

**Income Correlation:**
Generally high earners who've succeeded in markets:
- Tech sector ($120k-$500k+)
- Successful entrepreneurs ($150k+)
- Rationalist community members ($80k-$200k)
- Finance professionals who understand markets ($150k-$400k)

**Contradictions:**
Utilitarianism itself is contradictory ([[Utilitarianism]]) - it attempts to convert ordinal preferences to cardinal measurements and requires prior value creation to redistribute. On edge cases, they may accept aggression "if consequences are better," which contradicts NAP and opens door to [[Mixed Law]] reasoning.

**Population %:** ~0.5% globally (perhaps 2-4 million people)

---

## TIER 2: NAP-VIOLATORS - Minimal State

These positions accept the necessity of institutionalized aggression but want to "limit" it. They fail to grasp that you cannot limit an institution by granting it monopoly power ([[The Myth of Limited Government]]).

---

### Level 3: Minarchists / Night-Watchman State Advocates

**Definition:** Belief in "limited government" restricted to courts, police, and military. Accept taxation as necessary evil to fund these "essential" services. Essentially NAP + one giant exception.

**Core Philosophy:**
- NAP is correct... except for funding protection of NAP
- Private property is foundational... except state must tax it
- Markets work for everything... except law, defense, dispute resolution
- Government should be minimal but monopolistic in core functions
- Constitution can constrain state power (demonstrably false historically)

**Positions:**
- Minimal taxation (still theft, but "necessary")
- No welfare, no regulation, no economic intervention
- Free markets in all non-security sectors
- Strong property rights (except your tax money)
- Sound money often supported
- Open borders or very liberal immigration (usually)

**Example Persons/Types:**
- Robert Nozick (*Anarchy, State, and Utopia*)
- Ayn Rand and Objectivists
- Libertarian Party pragmatists
- Many Mises Institute readers who aren't full ancap
- "Constitutional conservative" types who actually mean it
- Small business owners who want government to leave them alone

**Income Correlation:**
Upper-middle to high earners who've seen government inefficiency:
- Business owners ($100k-$300k)
- Classical liberal academics ($70k-$120k)
- Successful professionals in private sector ($90k-$200k)
- Libertarian-leaning tech workers ($100k-$250k)

**Contradictions:**
Massive and fatal:
- **Who guards the guardians?** If the state interprets its own limits, limits are meaningless
- **Why would minimal state stay minimal?** Every "limited" government in history expanded
- **Taxation is theft** - they admit this but claim it's "necessary theft" (contradiction in terms)
- **Economic calculation problem applies to government courts/police** - without prices, cannot efficiently allocate security services
- **Constitution is paper** - interpreted by the very government it supposedly constrains

See: [[The Myth of Limited Government]]

**Population %:** ~1-2% in Western nations (perhaps 10-20 million globally)

---

### Level 4: Classical Liberals

**Definition:** Support for free markets and limited government, but accept state intervention in "market failures," "public goods," and infrastructure. Hayekian/Friedmanite compromise positions.

**Core Philosophy:**
- Markets generally work well
- Government should be limited but has legitimate roles
- Property rights important but not absolute
- Central banking acceptable if "well-managed"
- Some regulation needed for externalities
- Democracy can work with proper constraints

**Positions:**
- Low but not minimal taxation
- Free trade (usually, with some exceptions)
- Accept central banking (but want "rules-based" policy)
- Accept antitrust laws (cartels bad, except government)
- Support IP laws (economically illiterate position)
- Accept some "market failure" interventions
- Support public infrastructure (roads, courts, etc.)

**Example Persons/Types:**
- Milton Friedman (later period)
- F.A. Hayek (later period, after socialist calculation debate)
- Cato Institute / Reason Foundation types
- "Center-right" economists
- Business chamber of commerce leadership
- "Fiscal conservative, social liberal" types who mean it

**Income Correlation:**
Solidly upper-middle class, often in business or academia:
- Tenured economics professors ($90k-$180k)
- Upper management in corporations ($120k-$300k)
- Successful small business owners ($80k-$250k)
- Finance professionals ($100k-$400k)

**Contradictions:**
- **Accept central banking** despite Austrian business cycle theory proving it causes boom-bust
- **Support IP laws** despite them being government-granted monopolies that violate property rights
- **Accept antitrust** while opposing monopolies (state is the ultimate monopoly)
- **"Market failure" theory is flawed** - government failure is always worse due to calculation problem
- **Public goods theory is circular** - defines goods as public because markets "can't" provide them, then points to lack of private provision as proof

**Population %:** ~3-5% in developed nations (perhaps 50-100 million globally)

---

## TIER 3: NAP-VIOLATORS - Conservative Statism

These positions embrace free markets domestically but support massive state intervention in foreign policy, immigration, and "cultural" issues. Economics lite + nationalism.

---

### Level 5: Fiscal Conservatives / Paleolibertarians

**Definition:** Generally pro-market economics combined with social conservatism, nationalism, and protectionism. Against domestic welfare but pro-military, pro-borders, pro-tariffs.

**Core Philosophy:**
- Free markets good (domestically)
- Low taxes good (except to fund military)
- Welfare bad (for our citizens)
- Strong military necessary (at everyone else's expense)
- Borders are essential (but property borders aren't?)
- Traditional values should be enforced (culturally or legally)
- National sovereignty über alles

**Positions:**
- Low domestic taxation (but massive military spending)
- Against welfare state (redistribution bad!)
- Pro-military intervention (redistribution to defense contractors good!)
- Pro-tariffs and trade restrictions (because economics?)
- Anti-immigration (despite labor market economics)
- Often anti-drug, pro-police state for "law and order"
- May support subsidies for "strategic industries"

**Example Persons/Types:**
- Ron Paul fans (ironically, Ron Paul himself is better than this)
- MAGA conservatives with economic populism
- "America First" nationalists
- Paleolibertarian movement (Rockwell, some Hoppe followers)
- Tucker Carlson economic populism
- Small business owners who blame immigrants, not taxes
- Trade union members who want protectionism

**Income Correlation:**
Wide range, mostly middle class:
- Small business owners ($60k-$150k)
- Skilled tradesmen ($50k-$100k)
- Middle management ($70k-$120k)
- Self-employed contractors ($40k-$120k)

**Contradictions:**
Glaring and numerous:
- **Against redistribution domestically, for redistribution to military** - taxation is theft unless it's for bombs?
- **Pro-property rights, anti-immigration** - if you own property, you can invite whoever you want across it. Borders are state property claims
- **Pro-free market, pro-tariffs** - tariffs are taxes that make everyone poorer (Austrian econ 101)
- **Against welfare, for war** - war is the ultimate government waste and economic destruction
- **Claim to oppose big government** - while supporting the single largest government expenditure (military)

**Population %:** ~10-15% in USA, lower in Europe, varies by nation (perhaps 100-200 million globally)

---

### Level 6: Neoconservatives / Establishment Right

**Definition:** Corporate statism mixed with military imperialism and selective moral policing. "Conservative" socialism - regulate culture, subsidize business, export democracy at gunpoint.

**Core Philosophy:**
- Capitalism good (except when we need subsidies)
- Free markets good (except for strategic industries we lobby for)
- Small government good (except for military, police, surveillance)
- Traditional values important (enforce them!)
- American global hegemony essential (at taxpayer expense)

**Positions:**
- "Low" taxes (but massive spending = debt)
- Corporate subsidies and bailouts (socialism for the rich)
- Massive military budget (world police)
- Interventionist foreign policy (nation building)
- Surveillance state (for your safety)
- Drug war (government knows what's best for your body)
- Restrict abortion, gay marriage, etc. (small government!)
- Pro-police state domestically

**Example Persons/Types:**
- Bush-era GOP establishment
- Mainstream Republicans (McCain, Romney, etc.)
- Defense industry executives and lobbyists
- War hawk "intellectuals" (Bill Kristol, etc.)
- Corporate executives who love subsidies
- Suburban "law and order" conservatives
- Boomer conservatives who watch Fox News

**Income Correlation:**
Upper-middle to wealthy, but income from state-adjacent sources:
- Defense contractors ($150k-$500k+)
- Corporate executives in subsidized industries ($200k-$1M+)
- Lobbyists and beltway consultants ($150k-$400k)
- Upper management in legacy corporations ($120k-$300k)

**Contradictions:**
The entire ideology is contradictory:
- **"Small government" + massive military spending** - literally the biggest government program
- **"Fiscal responsibility" + endless wars** - Iraq/Afghanistan cost trillions
- **"Free markets" + corporate welfare** - subsidies, bailouts, tariffs for connected industries
- **"Traditional values" + bombing weddings** - how Christian is drone-striking civilians?
- **"Individual liberty" + surveillance state** - Patriot Act, NSA spying, etc.
- **Against socialism + for military socialism** - the military is centrally planned economy

**Population %:** ~10-15% in USA, less elsewhere (perhaps 150-250 million globally when including all flavors of right-wing statism)

---

## TIER 4: THE ECONOMICALLY INCOHERENT

This tier has **no** consistent philosophy. Positions are contradictory, case-by-case, feelings-based. This is where most "politically moderate" people land.

---

### Level 7: Centrists / Moderates

**Definition:** No coherent political philosophy. Picks positions based on "what sounds reasonable" without checking for logical consistency. Both-sides-ism as ideology. Fence-sitting as virtue.

**Core Philosophy:**
There is no philosophy. That's the point. They believe:
- "Both sides have good points"
- "Truth is somewhere in the middle"
- "Extremism is always bad"
- "Pragmatism over ideology"
- "Case-by-case basis"
- "Nuance" (translation: no principles)

**Positions:**
Totally incoherent. Examples of contradictory combinations:
- Pro-property rights + pro-wealth redistribution
- Pro-free market + pro-minimum wage
- Against government waste + for social programs
- Pro-choice + against euthanasia (or vice versa)
- Low taxes good + government services good
- Against war + support "humanitarian intervention"

Literally any combination is possible because there's no underlying framework.

**Example Persons/Types:**
- "Socially liberal, fiscally conservative" (meaningless phrase)
- Undecided voters who swing based on vibes
- NPR-listening professionals who think they're informed
- Suburban moderates who just want everyone to get along
- Corporate middle managers avoiding controversial opinions
- "I don't really follow politics" but votes anyway

**Income Correlation:**
Entire middle class spectrum:
- Mid-level professionals ($60k-$150k)
- Dual-income suburban households ($80k-$180k)
- Small business owners ($50k-$120k)
- Public sector workers ($50k-$90k)

**Contradictions:**
**EVERYTHING.** The entire position is contradictory because there is no position.

Some specific contradictions:
- **Want property rights protected but support redistribution** - you can't have both
- **Want free markets but support minimum wage** - price controls prevent market clearing
- **Want government services but low taxes** - where does the money come from?
- **Against extremism but for democracy** - majority rule is extremism of the mob
- **Claim to be pragmatic but ignore economic calculation problem** - pragmatism requires understanding cause and effect

**Population %:** ~20-30% in developed democracies (perhaps 500 million - 1 billion globally)

This is the most dangerous category per capita because they enable statism while thinking they're reasonable. They'll vote for parasitism while claiming to oppose it.

---

## TIER 5: NAP-VIOLATORS - Leftist Parasitism

These positions explicitly embrace wealth redistribution and state control. They've abandoned any pretense of property rights and embrace [[Aggression]] as legitimate for "equality" or "justice."

---

### Level 8: Social Democrats / Welfare State Supporters

**Definition:** Capitalism with heavy redistribution, regulation, and safety nets. "Compassionate" theft. Nordic model worship. Markets allowed to create wealth so state can redistribute it.

**Core Philosophy:**
- Capitalism creates wealth (true!)
- But markets produce "inequality" (so what?)
- Government should redistribute to create "fairness" (theft)
- Strong safety nets prevent poverty (actually trap people in poverty)
- Public services are rights (rights require others' labor?)
- Scandinavia is the model (ignoring they're crashing now)

**Positions:**
- High progressive taxation (50%+ on top earners)
- Universal healthcare (government monopoly)
- Free university (taxpayer subsidized)
- Strong labor regulations (price workers out of jobs)
- Environmental regulations (central planning)
- Wealth taxes (economic insanity)
- Corporate regulation (stifle competition)
- "Living wage" mandates (unemployment for low-skilled)

**Example Persons/Types:**
- Scandinavian politicians
- Bernie Sanders supporters (the "moderate" ones)
- Elizabeth Warren
- Western European center-left
- Urban progressives with government jobs
- University professors in humanities
- NGO workers
- Upper-middle class "allies" who virtue signal

**Income Correlation:**
Bimodal distribution:
- **High earners who feel guilty:** Academia ($70k-$150k), tech workers ($120k-$250k), inherited wealth ($0k-$500k+)
- **Low earners who want free stuff:** Service workers ($25k-$45k), part-time activists ($15k-$35k), students ($0k-$30k)

**Contradictions:**
- **Need capitalism to fund redistribution** - parasites need hosts
- **"Free" services** - someone pays, you're just hiding the cost
- **Wealth taxes destroy capital** - you're eating the seed corn
- **High taxes reduce tax base** - productive people leave or reduce output
- **Regulations help workers** - actually price low-skilled workers out of jobs
- **Markets fail, government succeeds** - [[Economic Calculation Problem]] proves opposite

**Population %:** ~15-20% in Western democracies, much lower elsewhere (perhaps 300-500 million globally)

---

### Level 9: Progressives / Democratic Socialists

**Definition:** Aggressive wealth redistribution, extensive state control, identity politics, equality of outcome. Markets are suspect, state planning is virtue. "Eat the rich" mentality.

**Core Philosophy:**
- Wealth is zero-sum (economically illiterate)
- Rich people are rich because they exploited others (ignores value creation)
- Poverty is caused by capitalism (ignores history - capitalism reduces poverty)
- Systemic oppression explains outcomes (denies individual agency)
- Government should control major sectors (central planning)
- Equality of outcome is justice (ignores differences in ability/effort)

**Positions:**
- Wealth confiscation (90%+ top marginal rates)
- Nationalize healthcare, education, housing
- Universal Basic Income (paying people not to work)
- Rent control (creates housing shortages)
- Green New Deal (economic suicide)
- Reparations for historical grievances (theft from people who weren't involved)
- Open borders + welfare state (economic impossibility)
- Worker cooperatives mandated (ignores why hierarchies exist)
- Abolish billionaires (abolish success)

**Example Persons/Types:**
- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
- Bernie Sanders
- Jeremy Corbyn (UK)
- The Squad (US Congress)
- Campus radicals
- Democratic Socialists of America members
- Trust-fund socialists
- Baristas with political science degrees

**Income Correlation:**
Heavily skewed to low earners + wealthy virtue signalers:
- **Low income:** Service industry ($20k-$40k), gig workers ($15k-$35k), unemployed activists ($0k-$25k)
- **High income:** Champagne socialists ($150k-$500k+), celebrity activists ($500k+), trust fund kids ($0k earned but wealthy)

**Contradictions:**
- **Hate capitalism, use iPhones** - everything they use was created by markets
- **Want to abolish billionaires** - who do they think creates jobs and wealth?
- **Support open borders + welfare state** - mathematically impossible to provide free stuff to infinite people
- **Blame systemic oppression** - why do some "oppressed" groups outperform "oppressor" groups?
- **Want equality of outcome** - requires totalitarian control to prevent people from voluntary exchange creating inequality
- **Think government can plan economy** - [[Economic Calculation Problem]] proves impossible

**Population %:** ~10-15% in Western nations, varies widely elsewhere (200-400 million globally)

---

### Level 10: Full Socialists

**Definition:** State ownership of means of production. Central planning. Private property in capital goods is exploitation. Markets are the problem. This is explicit rejection of economic reality.

**Core Philosophy:**
- Private property in capital goods = theft/exploitation (backwards causation)
- Workers are entitled to full value of output (ignores time preference, capital, risk)
- Markets create chaos and inequality (markets create order and prosperity)
- Central planning can allocate resources (calculation problem proves impossible)
- Labor theory of value (debunked by marginal utility)
- Revolution may be necessary (admitting people won't voluntarily choose this)

**Positions:**
- State ownership of all major industries
- Central planning of production
- Abolish stock markets (abolish price signals)
- Worker control of enterprises (workers ≠ capitalists for a reason)
- Abolish landlords (abolish housing market)
- Price controls on everything (shortages guaranteed)
- Ban private healthcare, education (force everyone into state system)
- Confiscate wealth above arbitrary threshold

**Example Persons/Types:**
- Marxist professors
- Communist party members (Western nations)
- Maduro/Chavez supporters
- Academic Marxists who've never run a business
- Professional revolutionaries
- Tankie subreddit users
- People who unironically say "real socialism hasn't been tried"

**Income Correlation:**
Extreme bimodal:
- **Very low income:** Perpetual students ($0k-$20k), career activists ($10k-$30k), unemployed ($0k-$15k)
- **High income academics:** Tenured Marxist professors ($80k-$150k), think tank socialists ($70k-$120k)

The pattern: people who've never created value in markets

**Contradictions:**
- **[[Socialism is impossible]]** - Economic Calculation Problem means they cannot efficiently allocate resources
- **Requires violence** - people won't voluntarily give up property, hence "revolution"
- **Claims to liberate workers** - actually enslaves everyone to state planners
- **Blames capitalism for poverty** - capitalism is what reduced global poverty from 90% to <10%
- **Points to Scandinavia** - those are welfare-state capitalist economies, not socialist
- **Ignores every socialist failure** - "That wasn't real socialism" (convenient excuse)

**Population %:** ~3-8% in Western nations, higher in some developing nations (150-300 million globally)

---

### Level 11: Communists / Marxist-Leninists

**Definition:** Complete abolition of private property. Dictatorship of the proletariat. From each according to ability, to each according to need. This is pure [[Parasitism]] - the consume-before-produce ethic that requires stealing from prior value creation.

**Core Philosophy:**
- Private property is theft (stolen concept fallacy - theft presupposes property)
- Class struggle is fundamental (polylogism - proletariat logic vs bourgeoisie logic)
- Dictatorship of proletariat necessary (admitting it requires force)
- Eventual stateless utopia (after we give state total power, it will wither away - sure)
- Historical materialism (deterministic view of history)
- Revolutionary violence justified (ethics based on class warfare)

**Positions:**
- Abolish all private property
- Collective ownership of everything
- Central planning of all production and distribution
- Liquidate bourgeoisie (genocide of productive class)
- Suppress counter-revolutionaries (murder dissenters)
- Reeducation camps (brainwashing)
- Complete economic control by party
- "New Socialist Man" (humanity must be rebuilt)

**Example Persons/Types:**
- USSR apologists
- Mao defenders
- Che Guevara worshippers
- Western Marxist-Leninists
- Communist party hardliners
- Some academic philosophers
- Antifa larpers
- Teenagers who think hammer-and-sickle is edgy

**Income Correlation:**
Overwhelmingly low income:
- Students ($0k-$20k)
- Baristas ($20k-$35k)
- Unemployed ($0k)
- Career protesters ($0k-$25k)
- Very rare: Champagne communists ($100k+) - academics, trust fund radicals

**Contradictions:**
**Every. Single. Thing.**

- **Abolishing property requires assuming property** - you can't steal what doesn't exist
- **From each ability, to each need** - who decides ability and need? (Central planner = new ruling class)
- **Dictatorship will "wither away"** - has never happened, never will - power doesn't voluntarily dissolve
- **Points to theory, ignores practice** - 100+ million deaths, every attempt failed
- **Classless society through class warfare** - polylogism ([[Mixed Law]]) is logically contradictory
- **Claims scientific socialism** - rejects empirical evidence of every failure
- **Liberation through totalitarianism** - enslavement is freedom, war is peace

**Population %:** ~1-3% in Western nations, higher in some nations with communist parties (75-150 million globally, mostly in China/former Soviet states as lingering ideology)

---

## SPECIAL CATEGORY: THE IGNORANT MASSES

This isn't a political position. It's the absence of political thought. This is the majority.

---

### Level 12: The Politically Unaware (NPCs)

**Definition:** No coherent political philosophy whatsoever. Pure reactionaries. Tax slaves who accept whatever the state does as "just how things are." They lack the will, determination, or cognitive capacity to question authority or understand economic cause-and-effect.

**Core Philosophy:**
There is no philosophy. There is no thought. There is only reaction to stimuli:
- "That's just the way it is"
- "You have to pay taxes, everyone does"
- "The government needs to do something"
- "I don't really follow politics"
- "Both sides are the same"
- Votes based on vibes, if at all
- No understanding of economics whatsoever

**Positions:**
None that are thought-through. They'll agree with:
- Whoever sounds confident
- Whoever promises them stuff
- Whoever their family/friends support
- Whoever was on TV
- Whatever doesn't require them to think

**Characteristics:**
- Work paycheck to paycheck, never question why purchasing power declines
- Cannot articulate what money is, what banks do, why government prints currency
- Accept price increases as "just inflation" without understanding cause
- Vote tribally or don't vote at all
- No awareness of [[Economic Calculation Problem]], [[Subjective Value Theory]], opportunity cost, comparative advantage
- Cannot connect policy to outcome
- Lack will to overcome obstacles (survival of the fittest - some adapt, some don't)
- Not malicious, just... not thinking

**Example Persons/Types:**
- Most service workers who never question the system
- Paycheck-to-paycheck middle class
- People who "don't follow politics"
- Low-information voters
- Anyone who thinks voting changes anything but can't explain policy
- People who accept whatever government does
- Those who blame "corporations" or "the rich" without understanding markets
- The masses who enable tyranny through passive acceptance

**Income Correlation:**
Primarily low-to-lower-middle income:
- Minimum wage workers ($15k-$30k)
- Unskilled labor ($25k-$45k)
- Retail/service industry ($20k-$40k)
- Some middle-class workers who just clock in/out ($40k-$70k)

**Why They Matter:**
This is the **largest** category. **40-50%** of any population falls here.

They're not actively parasitic. They're not ideologically committed to statism. They're just... **not thinking**. And that makes them:
- **Vulnerable to demagoguery:** Promise them free stuff, they'll vote for it
- **Enablers of tyranny:** They won't resist because they don't understand what's happening
- **Dead weight:** They don't contribute to political discourse or economic innovation

In democracy, they're **cannon fodder**. Whoever can manipulate them controls policy. They'll vote to rob productive people because they don't understand that redistribution requires prior production. They'll support inflation because they don't grasp that printing money reduces purchasing power.

They're not evil. They're just... **NPCs**. And their massive numbers mean they determine electoral outcomes in democracies, which is why [[Democracy is garbage]].

**Population %:** ~40-50% in developed nations, potentially higher in developing nations (3-4 billion people globally)

**Contradictions:**
They don't hold positions long enough to contradict themselves. They just... exist. Consume. Work. Repeat. No political thought at all.

## Using This Spectrum

### Mapping Individuals

Listen to someone's positions on:
1. **Taxation:** Theft or necessary? For what purposes?
2. **Property rights:** Absolute or conditional?
3. **State power:** Should exist at all? For what?
4. **Economic intervention:** Ever justified?
5. **Sound money:** Do they understand why fiat is theft?

Their answers place them on the spectrum.

### Gauging Populations

Estimate distribution percentages in a country/region:
- What % are above NAP line? (Prosperity indicator)
- What % are economically literate? (Innovation indicator)
- What % are NPCs? (Vulnerability to demagoguery)
- What % explicitly embrace parasitism? (Collapse indicator)

### Predicting Trajectories

**Prosperity formula:**
- 10%+ classical liberal or better
- <30% explicit socialists
- <40% NPCs
- Strong property rights institutions
- Sound money preference (or at least understanding)

**Collapse formula:**
- <5% economic literacy
- >30% explicit parasites (socialists/communists)

## Conclusion

This spectrum reveals a brutal truth: **Economic literacy is vanishingly rare**, and that rarity determines national fate.

Most people are:
- Below the NAP line (accepting aggression as legitimate)
- Economically illiterate (don't understand calculation problem, property rights, sound money)
- Either actively parasitic or passively accepting of parasitism

The ratio of producers to parasites, of economically literate to illiterate, of NAP-compliant to NAP-violating - **this determines everything.**

Use this spectrum to:
- Understand why nations fail
- Predict political trajectories
- Identify where economic literacy concentrates
- Recognize contradictions in stated positions
- Map your own community/nation/region

The future belongs to those who understand [[Argumentation Ethics]], reject [[Aggression]], grasp the [[Economic Calculation Problem]], and recognize that [[Socialism is impossible]].

Everyone else is building the collapse they'll eventually inhabit.
