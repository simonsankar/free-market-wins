The claim that inflation can be beneficial — if only we find the "optimal rate" — is one of the most pervasive economic fallacies of our time. This essay demonstrates, through praxeological reasoning, why inflation is *always* harmful, regardless of the rate, and why no central planner can ever determine an "optimal" amount of monetary debasement.

## The Island Economy: A Clear Mental Model

Imagine an island with 10 people. They've discovered gold nuggets and decide to use them as money. There happen to be exactly 10 gold nuggets on the island — one per person on average.

### Initial Money Supply Is Irrelevant

Here's the crucial insight: *it doesn't matter how many nuggets they start with*. Whether the island has 1 nugget, 10 nuggets, or 1,000 nuggets, the economy will function identically. Why? Because prices adjust.

If there's only 1 nugget:
- A chicken might cost 0.001 nuggets
- A fish might cost 0.0005 nuggets

If there are 1,000 nuggets:
- A chicken might cost 10 nuggets
- A fish might cost 5 nuggets

The *ratio* between goods remains the same. The absolute number of monetary units is economically meaningless at the outset. Humans will simply divide or multiply the unit as needed. One nugget can be conceptually divided into 1,000 pieces, or 10,000 pieces — whatever trade requires. This is why [[Bitcoin]] works perfectly fine with only 21 million units that can be divided to 8 decimal places (satoshis) or beyond.

The advocate for inflation often conflates *starting* with more money and *adding* money later. These are categorically different phenomena.

## Where Inflation Begins: The Introduction of New Money

Now suppose the island economy has been running with 10 nuggets. Prices have settled: a chicken costs 1 nugget, a fish costs 0.5 nuggets. People have saved, traded, and planned their futures based on this monetary reality.

Then the chief (our stand-in for government) discovers a way to create 5 counterfeit nuggets indistinguishable from real ones.

### The Moment of Theft

When the chief spends these 5 new nuggets, something insidious happens. He walks into the market where prices still reflect the old 10-nugget reality. He buys chickens at 1 nugget each — but his nuggets represent *nothing*. No prior production. No saved value. No deferred consumption. They appeared from nowhere.

The chief has just acquired real goods — chickens that required real labour to raise — in exchange for nothing. This is theft by any coherent definition.

### The Cantillon Effect in Action

As these 5 new nuggets circulate, prices *gradually* rise. But not uniformly.

1. **First recipients benefit**: The chief and those he pays directly get to spend at old prices
2. **Middle recipients break even**: By the time money reaches them, some prices have risen
3. **Last recipients are robbed**: They face higher prices but never received any new money

This is the [[Cantillon Effect]] — the systematic redistribution from those furthest from the money printer to those closest to it. It's not a bug of monetary expansion; it's the core mechanism.

When prices finally equilibrate at the new 15-nugget reality:
- Chickens now cost 1.5 nuggets
- Fish now costs 0.75 nuggets

Everyone who held the original 10 nuggets has lost exactly 1/3 of their purchasing power. That wealth didn't disappear — it was *transferred* to the chief.

## The Non-Consensual Nature of Inflation

Your opponent might argue: "Sure, people lose purchasing power, but it goes back into the economy and benefits everyone."

This argument fails on multiple levels:

### 1. Consent Was Never Given

When you work and earn 1 nugget, you exchanged your time and labour for that unit. It represents *your* deferred consumption, *your* stored value. When inflation reduces it to 0.67 nuggets in purchasing power, you've been robbed of 0.33 nuggets worth of value.

The fact that this stolen value "went into the economy" is irrelevant. If I steal your car and donate it to charity, you've still been robbed. The destination of stolen goods doesn't legitimize the theft.

### 2. Allocation Without Choice

Perhaps those 10 original nugget-holders wanted to:
- Save for retirement
- Invest in a fishing business
- Buy land for their children
- Simply hold wealth in liquid form

The chief decided, unilaterally, that their 0.33 nuggets each would instead fund *his* priorities — perhaps a palace, perhaps a "public" project. The holders never consented to this allocation.

If people *wanted* a particular project funded, they could voluntarily pool resources. The fact that coercive extraction is required proves the project *fails the market test* — it is not valued highly enough by those who must pay for it.

### 3. The "Collective Benefit" Delusion

The inflation advocate must believe the central planner knows better than individuals what benefits them. This contradicts the fundamental insight of praxeology: [[Human Action]] is purposeful behaviour aimed at removing felt uneasiness. Each person ranks their needs and wants according to their own subjective valuation.

The chief cannot know:
- That Alice values a new boat more than the "public garden" he's funding
- That Bob would rather save for his daughter's dowry than contribute to the road project
- That Carol's "unproductive" hoarding is actually rational preparation for a personal emergency

The [[Economic Calculation Problem]] isn't just a computational difficulty — it's a *logical impossibility*. Without market prices generated by voluntary exchange, there is no way to rationally allocate resources. The central planner is flying blind.

## Deflation Is the Natural State of Progress

Consider what happens in an uninflated economy over time.

Year 1: 10 nuggets exist. A chicken costs 1 nugget.

Year 5: Still 10 nuggets. But farmers have improved breeding techniques, built better coops, and optimized feed ratios. Production costs have fallen. Competition forces prices down.

Now a chicken costs 0.7 nuggets.

Your saved nugget now buys *more* than before. This is the reward for deferred consumption — the natural interest rate expressing time preference.

### The Technology Proof

We accept this reality with technology:
- A calculator once cost a week's wages. Now it's a free app.
- A computer that filled a room now fits in your pocket and costs a fraction.
- International video calls were science fiction. Now they're free.

This is capitalism working correctly: [[Competition]] drives innovation, innovation increases productivity, productivity lowers costs, lower costs mean lower prices.

Why should chickens be different? Why should housing? Why should healthcare?

They shouldn't. The reason these necessities get *more* expensive while technology gets *cheaper* is precisely because of monetary inflation combined with regulatory capture. The sectors with the most government intervention — healthcare, education, housing — show the worst price increases.

## The Impossibility of an "Optimal" Inflation Rate

Your opponent retreats to: "Okay, maybe uncontrolled inflation is bad, but surely there's some optimal rate..."

This position is untenable for several reasons:

### 1. Heterogeneity of Individuals

If the "optimal" rate is 5%:
- Someone with $100 loses $5 of purchasing power annually
- Someone with $100,000 loses $5,000 of purchasing power annually

You're telling the second person they must find investments returning >5% just to *preserve* their wealth — let alone grow it. This isn't a policy; it's a forced wealth transfer from savers to borrowers, from the cautious to the reckless.

### 2. The Knowledge Problem

To determine an "optimal" rate, the central planner would need to know:
- Every individual's time preference
- Every possible investment opportunity
- Every future innovation
- Every shifting consumer desire
- Every supply chain disruption
- Every productivity gain

This information doesn't exist in aggregated form. It exists only as dispersed knowledge in millions of minds, revealed only through the price signals of voluntary exchange. The planner cannot access it.

### 3. The Political Reality

Even *if* an optimal rate existed, what political mechanism would find and maintain it? Central bankers are:
- Politically appointed
- Subject to pressure from elected officials
- Incentivized to inflate (it funds government spending without explicit taxation)
- Never punished for inflation (the public blames "greedy corporations")

The institution designed to "optimally manage" the money supply has every incentive to over-inflate and zero incentive for restraint.

### 4. The Argentina Test

If printing money created wealth, Argentina would be the richest nation on Earth. Zimbabwe would be paradise. Venezuela would be an economic miracle.

The fact that hyperinflation destroys economies proves the endpoint of inflationary logic. If *some* inflation is good, *more* should be better. But it isn't. This reveals that inflation isn't adding value — it's extracting it until the host dies.

## The Core Deception: "Money Going Into the Economy"

When your opponent says "the $2 you lost went into the economy," he's performing a sleight of hand.

That $2 of purchasing power didn't appear from nowhere. It was *transferred* from you to the first spenders of new money. The economy has the same amount of real goods and services. Only the distribution has changed — and it changed through theft, not voluntary exchange.

Consider:
- If the government extracts $2 from you through taxation, at least it's visible
- If the government extracts $2 through inflation, it's invisible theft
- In both cases, the government has your $2
- In both cases, you have $2 less purchasing power

Inflation is merely [[Taxation]] with extra steps and better PR.

## Why the Single-Coin Argument Fails

Your opponent argued that a single coin would create liquidity problems — people waiting for the coin to "come around" to them.

This misunderstands money entirely.

First: The coin can be divided. If trade requires it, the coin becomes 100 cents, or 1,000 mills, or any division needed. Digital ledgers make this trivial.

Second: Credit emerges naturally. If Bob wants to buy from Alice but the coin is with Carol, Bob can promise Alice future payment. Markets develop [[Credit]] systems, IOUs, and netting arrangements spontaneously.

Third: The "liquidity" concern confuses money quantity with transaction frequency. More coins don't enable more trades — they just mean each trade uses larger nominal numbers.

The push for "more money supply" is always and everywhere a push to benefit those who receive the new money first — and that's never the working class.

## The Verdict

Inflation is:
1. **Non-consensual** — value is extracted without permission
2. **Redistributive** — from savers to spenders, from late receivers to early receivers
3. **Calculationally destructive** — it distorts the price signals markets need to allocate resources
4. **Impossible to optimize** — the knowledge required doesn't exist in accessible form
5. **Politically irredeemable** — every incentive pushes toward more inflation, not "optimal" inflation

There is no version of monetary inflation that benefits the economy in aggregate. There is only visible theft (taxation) and invisible theft (inflation), with the latter being worse because its victims don't even know they're being robbed.

The solution is [[Sound Money]] — whether gold, [[Bitcoin]], or any money whose supply cannot be arbitrarily expanded by political actors. Under sound money, the natural tendency of capitalism is *deflation* — ever-more goods at ever-lower prices, rewarding savers and punishing malinvestment.

This isn't utopian. It's simply what happens when you remove the thief from the mint.
