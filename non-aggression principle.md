The **non-aggression principle** (also called the **non-aggression axiom**, or the **anti-coercion** or **zero aggression principle** or **non-initiation of force**) is an ethical stance which asserts that "[aggression](https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Aggression "Aggression")" is inherently illegitimate. "Aggression" is defined as the "initiation" of physical force against persons or property, the threat of such, or [fraud](https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Fraud "Fraud") upon persons or their property. In contrast to [pacifism](https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Pacifism "Pacifism"), the non-aggression principle does not preclude [violent](https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Violence "Violence") [self-defense](https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Self-defense "Self-defense"). The principle is a [deontological](https://wiki.mises.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Deontological&action=edit&redlink=1 "Deontological (page does not exist)") (or rule-based) ethical stance.
