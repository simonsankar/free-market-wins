Add some preamble that discusses how we live in a world of scarce resources and thus the only way for us to have civilization and prosperity is to have property rights — why do anything when someone can come and steal it from you? Putting arbitrary limits on what you can own falls into [[Primacy of Consciousness]] so you can own anything as long as it is obtained without conflict (oxymoron to state it this way since ownership means just direction of the resource)

Starts with self-ownership — you own yourself since you are the only one that can direct its use Arguing against this results in an obvious contradiction ([[Argumentation Ethics]])

From owning ourselves we move onto external resources and there are 3 ways in which one can obtain them
- [[Homesteading (First-comer Ethic)]]
- [[Production]]
- [[Trade]]
